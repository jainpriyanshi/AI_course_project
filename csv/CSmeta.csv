5,"<p>Actually, SO has <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/homework"">over 15,300 questions tagged homework</a>. I often see people adding and suggesting the tag if a question looks like it might be HW. I think it is a good idea to have the tag, if for nothing other than indicating that any answers to the question are not (or should not be) complete, but instead guidance towards the correct solution.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Let's look at some of our sister sites.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a> has long had a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/homework""><code>homework</code> tag</a> (the 62nd most used tag). It often causes friction: people add the <code>homework</code> tag to random questions, sometimes indiscriminately. People leave sometimes very aggressive comments: “is it homework? -1” when a post doesn't have the homework tag but should have it in their view. Askers reply “no its not homework” even when it patently is, leading to edit wars.</p>

<p>Drama regularly erupts on Meta Stack Overflow about homework and its tag. Recent occurrences include <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/123758/can-we-now-burninate-the-homework-tag-and-discourage-its-use"">Can we now burninate the homework tag and discourage its use?</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130558/can-we-cut-back-on-the-is-this-homework-berating"">Can we cut back on the “Is This Homework?” berating?</a> on one side, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130603/what-are-some-homework-red-flags"">What are some homework red flags?</a> on the other side.</p>

<p>Eventually <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/147100/the-homework-tag-is-now-officially-deprecated"">Stack Overflow got rid of its <code>homework</code> tag</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/"">Programmers</a> has long had a few questions tagged <code>homework</code> and <a href=""https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3202/blacklist-homework"">recently got rid of the tag for good</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/"">Theoretical Computer Science</a> is not relevant here because it is research-level only.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/"">Mathematics</a> required the <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/tags/homework""><code>homework</code> tag</a> for a long time, as per its <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1803/how-to-ask-a-homework-question"">homework policy</a>. There are ongoing debates about the policy, with <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4154/a-consolidated-homework-policy"">a sizable opposition</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/14981/homework-tag-should-be-deprecated-votings-over-you-wont-believe-what-won"">a vote</a> shows a strong majority against having the <code>homework</code> tag, leading to <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/16425/fate-of-homework-the-community-voted-now-what"">the tag's removal</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/"">Physics</a> has a <a href=""https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/714/how-do-i-ask-homework-questions-on-physics-stack-exchange"">homework policy</a> that is very similar to Math's former policy, requiring the use of a <code>homework</code> tag.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The one advantage I see to the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homework"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;homework&#39;"" rel=""tag"">homework</a> tag is that it's a marker for questions for which a complete answer is not provided, only hints. This implies that two otherwise identical questions, one tagged <code>homework</code>, the other not, deserve different answers and therefore cannot be duplicates. Conversely, the downside of not having a <code>homework</code> tag is that a homework question might poison a legitimate question, because the next visitor with the same question wasn't doing homework and really needed the answer.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage I see to the <code>homework</code> tag is the amount of friction it generates. If the tag exists, we need to manage the case where</p>

<ul>
<li>the asker vehemently denies that it's homework, and wants a full answer;</li>
<li>someone else vehemently claims that it's obviously homework.</li>
</ul>

<p>If it may or may not be homework, is it homework? Will you delete a full answer just because someone claims that the asker was cheating on homework?</p>

<p>If a student wants to have his homework done for him, and someone is willing to do it, that's fine with me. The student will eventually fail the course for lack of studying; too bad. If the question is a dump of the homework assignment, closing as <em>not a real question</em> may be warranted in some circumstances (typically, when the student only posted part of the assignment, and the posted text makes no sense on its own; or if the question is a scan of the homework sheet (true story!); or if the post is several unrelated questions).</p>

<p>On the other hand, I do not want the efforts of people who write answers to be for nothing: I am against moderating full answers to homework questions. If a partial answer is desired, the question can be worded accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am stuck in this assignment about &lt;subject&gt;. Question 1 was …, and I solved it by &lt;method&gt;. Question 2 is …, and I'm stuck. How can I get started?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No need for a framing tag, and <em>this</em> question clearly does not call for a full answer, and would not be a duplicate of a question calling for a full answer.</p>

<p>For these reasons, <strong>I am against having a <code>homework</code> tag at all.</strong></p>

5,"<p>There have been many questions on CST that were either closed, or just not answered because they weren't considered research level. May those questions (as long as they are of good quality) be reposted or moved here?</p>

<p>If a question is asked on CSTheory, is a generally good CS question but is not research-level, it should be migrated to CS. I expect that when CS graduates, it will become a migration target for CSTheory; in the meantime CSTheory moderators can migrate the question.</p>

<p>Conversely, if a question about theoretical CS is asked on CS and turns out to be research-level, it may be migrated to CSTheory (by a CS moderator).</p>

<p>As long as we're in private beta, it's too early for any migration. Generally migrations should wait until the target site has moderators (this is not a hard-and-fast rule).

<p>List questions on Stack Overflow have long been frowned upon, and are officially banned. Old ones have often attracted a large collection of low-quality answers. New ones are generally closed (unless they fall through the radar, always a possibility with ~5000 questions daily). Older questions are sometimes kept around because part of the SO community is dead set against deletions, but this should not be taken as evidence that these questions would be accepted if they were posted today.</p>

<p><a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/"">Community Wiki does not change the acceptability of a question.</a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/"">Literature</a> site has a <a href=""https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/203/policy-trial-notice-book-recommendations"">limited book recommendation policy</a>. In a nutshell, book recommendations are allowed if they are reasonably specific and encourage answers that describe a curriculum rather than a single book. This policy has had mixed results; the quality of these questions is usually not very good but the bad ones can and do get closed and a few get good answers. <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/"">Programmers</a> has a different <a href=""https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2665/whats-up-with-all-the-book-recommendation-flags"">book recommendation policy</a> which is somewhat similar in spirit; on Programmers, a vast majority of incoming questions do not meet the policy.</p>

<p>Researcher communities are somewhat unusual; what works on CSTheory is unlikely to work on a less elitist site.</p>

5,"<p>This is my first time to be involved in a site beta, and I would like to gauge the community's opinion on this subject.</p>

<p>On StackOverflow (and possibly Math.SE), questions on introductory formal language and automata theory pop up... questions along the lines of ""How do I show language L is/isn't regular?"", ""How do I show language L is/isn't context-free?"", ""How do you convert a NFA to a DFA?"", etc. I assume that questions such as these are unambiguously on-topic here; please correct me if I am mistaken.</p>

<p>Other questions, such as ""How do I get a regular expression (regular grammar, context-free grammar, context-sensitive grammar, unrestricted grammar, DFA, NFA, PDA, LBA, TM, etc.) for language L?"", are probably also appropriate here, although I suppose these could be construed as programming questions (in a sense, it's sort of equivalent) and therefore more appropriate for StackOverflow. What are the thoughts on this? I feel like this community would be better suited to providing correct and complete answers to such questions.</p>

<p>What about questions regrding normalizing relations in relational database theory? What about questions on proving loop invariants, or asymptotic bounds by induction? EDIT: What about questions from operating systems, such as on the optimality of scheduling policies, dining philosophers, etc.? What about questions from computer architecture, networks, parallel computing, etc. that don't involve programming and don't involve hardware? Perhaps even more interestingly, what about questions on the syntax and semantics of specific real programming languages (i.e., what does the following C code do, and why does it do that? Something from an introductory course on programming language theory). EDIT: For instance, what about the following question, from a CS GRE?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider the following Pascal-like program fragment:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>var i, j : integer;
procedure P(k, m : integer) ;
begin
  k := k - m;
  m := k + m;
  k := m - k;
end;
i := 2;
j := 3;
P(i, j);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>If both parameters to P are passed by reference, what are the values
  of i and j at the end of the program fragment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT: Now that I look at the kind of questions I had in mind, I feel like they're more likely to be questions with pseudocode... if the syntax matches that of a particular language, it's probably just a pseudocode convention adopted by the authors. As such, questions specific to real capabilities of real languages are probably not appropriate...</p>

<p>My gut feeling is that all of this should be unambiguously on-topic, with the caveats associated with ""homework"" questions. I thought I would ask, however, since a lot of that is being asked on StackOverflow and Math.SE.</p>

5,"<p>This is my first time to be involved in a site beta, and I would like to gauge the community's opinion on this subject.</p>

<p>Certainly, there are many kinds of questions which we could expect to (eventually) be asked on CS.SE; lots of candidates were proposed during the lead-up to the Beta, and a few posts in Meta are still trying to clarify these. Let's assume that topic X, in its entirety, is always on-topic for this site. Is it appropriate to stock the Beta with easy, or introductory, or beginning, or ""frequently asked"", questions on topic X, so that the site will have a repository of (hopefully good) answers to common question, before a public launch?</p>

<p>For instance, would it be appropriate for me to ask a questions of the form:</p>

<ol>
<li>I need to show that language L is/isn't regular/context-free, but I don't know how to get started. How can this be done?</li>
<li>I need to show that language L is/isn't regular/context-free using method/technique X, but I don't know how to get started (<em>or I don't understand step K, for each K</em>). How does one use method/technique X?</li>
<li>I need to convert this NFA to an equivalent DFA. How can this be done?</li>
<li>I need to convert this NFA to an equivalent DFA using Kleene's theorem, but I don't know how to get started (<em>or understand step K, for each K</em>).</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>, then, after asking questions, give them a few days to collect some answers, possibly add an answer of my own, vote up and select a best response as appropriate?</p>

<p>This has yet to happen, though, and till then SE is ontopic on cs.SE, imho.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I don't think pure programming questions should be on topic here - no matter how easy or difficult they are.</p>

<p>You should decide whether to ask here or on Stack Overflow based on the topic, not the difficulty. Questions of all levels of difficulty are on topic on Stack Overflow and the same is true here. Questions should go to Stack Overflow if they're purely programming related and here otherwise.</p>

<p>I also don't think basic programming questions necessarily get downvoted on Stack Overflow. In my experience they only do if they show a clear lack of effort. However I'm not very active in the Java tag - maybe Java programmers downvote more easily than others.</p>

<p>So to summarize: In my opinion the policy on easy questions should be that they're perfectly acceptable (though you shouldn't ask questions that you can easily answer yourself just to ask a question and you should make an effort to come up with the answer yourself first) and the policy on programming questions should be that they belong on Stack Overflow.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Of course they should be on topic. Graduate level questions go on TCS, what would it leave us if we didn't take undergrad questions (even just ""introductory"" ones)? And ""introductory"" is rather ambiguous.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>What sepp2k says, <em>but</em> I think we should be open towards question by real novices; those we should answer in a pro, but helpful way. Being friendly towards novices is essential for long-term success of the site.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think algorithms and data structures should be on-topic, but not going from theory to the actual implementation. So regarding your example:</p>

<p>We should remove the ""in Java"" and address it at a more theoretical level.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The CS.SE site was set up, in my understanding, to satisfy a need: the need for a place for CS students, academics, and professionals to ask questions related to CS, which do not meet the criteria for sister sites (especially StackOverflow and CS Theory). Naturally, a mature CS.SE should be expected to overlap (to some degree) with Math.SE, StackOverflow, and cstheory.SE, but the idea of bringing in mathematicians, theoretical computer scientists and software developers to build a distinct community remains; that is, non-research-level, non-programming CS questions are really only on-topic on Math.SE, and that's not really an optimal situation.</p>

<p>Software engineering, imho, is another story. Programmers.SE already has an established community for asking questions related to software engineering, and they do not discriminate on the basis of question level or theory content (as far as I'm aware). From the Programmers.SE FAQ, questions on the following are the on-topic subjects there:</p>

<ol>
<li>algorithm and data structure concepts</li>
<li>design patterns</li>
<li>developer testing</li>
<li>development methodologies</li>
<li>freelancing and business concerns</li>
<li>quality assurance</li>
<li>software architecture</li>
<li>software engineering</li>
<li>software licensing</li>
</ol>

<p>Of the 9 explicitly listed on-topic subjects, fully 6 are unambiguously, unquestionably, undeniably the sole subject matter of software engineering. That is, 2/3 of the subjects are software engineering proper, which leads me to the following lines of thought: there is already a non-research-level SE site where questions of all kinds related to software engineering are explicitly allowed; there is no need to have a new SE allow these questions, although it certainly could; ""computer science"" and ""software engineering"" are already understood to be distinct, even if the distinction is not yet strong; the distinction should be expected to become more marked in the future.</p>

<p>Taking these factors into account, I'm not sure I see any value in promoting the asking of software engineering questions here, any more than I see value in continuing to promote the asking of CS questions on Math.SE. I would say that the position should be that, while perhaps questions on software engineering aren't forbidden here, they're not really appropriate, and this community isn't the best one to address them. EDIT: To be more explicit, I say that if we must either completely allow or completely prohibit questions on software engineering, I say we prohibit them.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>In this case, we probably should ask the questioner to generalise their question, e.g. ""How to efficiently compute the symmetrical difference of linked lists?"". This general question is ontopic (even if very basic) and the user should be able to apply answers (which are now useful to more people!) to their specific language setting.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>In my opinion this particular question should be in scope.</p>

<p>Computer Science is a unique blend. On one hand it shares with mathematics the formal aspects. On the other hand it shares with natural sciences the experimental aspects. I suppose no-one would argue for banning questions related to experimental algorithmics. So, why would we ban questions related to other kinds of experiments?</p>

<p>What if someone would ask whether there is evidence that static typing improves productivity? Should that be banned? Before you answer, take a moment to read how Wadler, a very well known researcher in the theory of programming languages, <a href=""http://wadler.blogspot.com/2011/09/experiment-about-static-and-dynamic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">pleads for more experimental research</a> that could shed light on this question.</p>

<p>I agree that many other venues that allow ""software engineering"" questions are full of subjective and endless arguments. All the more reason to allow such questions here, I say. But make sure we only answer with facts.</p>

<li>Proving theorems in a way that can be automated in the chosen formal setting.</li>

<p>The border of the site is not between theory and application, but between science and engineering.</p>

<p>(Not that it's easy to define either way.)</p>

<p>ps: I think Raphael has a valid point, but I think if every question has one or two subject classification tags then these tags will automatically become the most popular ones and will be easily recognizable from the rest.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>This is a tough question, but one which, imho, must be satisfactorily addressed as soon as possible if this site is to present a unified front to the rest of the community when the site goes public.</p>

<p>My opinion is that the primary focus of this site should be things which can be clearly categorized as belonging to ""computer science"" and for which there does not already exist another dedicated SE site, possibly to the explicit exclusion of everything else (or at least that should be the basic policy position).</p>

<p>To see what I mean, let's look at your examples. Software engineering is being discussed in another Meta thread, and I state my opinion there: that the charter of Programmers.SE already explicitly permits discussions relating to all aspects of software engineering, and as such, there is no reason to encourage software engineering experts to leave Programmers and come here. That's ignoring the argument that the distinction between ""computer science"" and ""software engineering"" seems to be getting increasingly important and recognized. Lots of subjects are closely related, but that doesn't preclude having separate SEs for them.</p>

<p>There are already SE sites for IT security and cryptography; anything that can't be answered there is probably either mathematics, system administration or research-level theoretical computer science. If it's a programming issue, SO, codereview and codegolf probably have it covered. I see no value in adding another place to ask questions about computer security.</p>

<p>Regarding Computer Architecture, there is a site proposal in Area 51 (http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/19424/computer-architecture-organization), and to some degree I think that superuser.SE and serverfault.SE might already handle some questions... I do not necessarily see a lot of value in encouraging these kinds of questions on this site. That being said, there are of course computer science questions which arise in the study of these things (such as dining philosophers, optimality of scheduling algorithms, rules governing speedup of parallel computations, etc.) which would be more appropriate here than there. This is a different scenario from e.g. formal methods and software engineering, since formal methods are inherently a part of software engineering, whereas e.g. the dining philosophers problem is not a part of operating systems, per se, although it is used (as is mathematics, for instance).</p>

<p>AI seems to be waiting to see how this site goes, so I feel like it's fine to allow questions in this area until they decide what they're going to do. After all, we won't know whether we can attract an AI community here unless we allow such questions.</p>

<p>As far as computer graphics is concerned, I'm not sure how many genuine CS questions you can ask about this that wouldn't be programming-related or essentially mathematics (geometry, linear algebra, etc.). If, however, you were to find a few (computational geometry, perhaps, or anything that meets the charter of this site), then I think it would be OK.</p>

<p>To sum up, I think we should have the same stance as we do with programming and SO: if there's already an established site for it, and there's no good reason why that site can't address the needs of that community, there's no reason to allow it here. We can certainly allow it anyway, although there's no reason to encourage it. Doing so would hurt more than help, in my opinion.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The [programmers.se] also allows algorithms and data structure questions. Should we also forbid them on this site? </p>

<p>I think this is not the right attitude to look at the picture. With this attitude, at the end we are going to be left with only non-research level theoretical questions (which themselves were already on-topic on [math.se]). </p>

<p>So if we are going to go this way we should stop building the site right now and not waste our time building a site which is going to be obsolete. There are lots of Software Engineering questions which are more computer engineering questions than computer science question (though the line separating them is not black and white).</p>

But simultaneously it is a generic principle to prove something in Coq, which is a job for computer science. I could understand considering that part to be off-topic, but it's not clear-cut.</p>

<p>Why it doesn't work is a question about the theory behind Coq (the calculus of inductive constructions) or about one of the most subtle matters in the way Coq implements said calculus. This is definitely computer science, not programming.</p>

5,"<p>I suspect some of the problems come from the private beta stage, since many of the early adopters came from cstheory/math. My hope is that once the beta opens up, 'regular CS' folk will come in and start posting questions. I do agree that currently the questions are 'theory heavy' even though they're not necessarily CSTheory-appropriate questions. </p>

5,"<p>MathJax does use $ as delimiters - we can change the default for this site if there is enough community support.  </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>This seems to be a nasty interaction between MathJax and markdown. The parser is thrown off by the presence of nested <code>$</code> signs inside <code>\text</code> and that triggers some markdown expansion which strips one level of <code>\</code>. Normally all markdown expansion is turned off inside MathJax, so the <code>\</code> signs arrive unmangled to the MathJax interpreter.</p>

<p>A possible workaround here is to use <code>\(…\)</code> instead of <code>$…$</code>.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I was REALLY excited when this site went into public beta because I've seriously been waiting for a forum to which I can get guidance on my CS homework as I go through my classes. Math.se has been great for the problems I have that require a mathematical answer (like when I measure time complexity, etc), but I've had problems where I need to come up with an algorithm to solve some problem, or I need to figure out how to traverse some graph or something and I never had a specific place I could go to for some guidance on these elementary (or not so elementary) problems. </p>

<p>I was hoping that this site would be my whit knight on horseback coming to my rescue. </p>

<p>As I've experience from TCS, there is an elitist attitude often experienced when in the field of computer science and things that might seem simple to one person aren't so simple I others.</p>

<p>So, what I'm trying to say is, I'm hoping that CS.se would become like math.se and welcome every level of computer science question so no one would feel like they need to read 3 more algorithm text books, or already have their BS before asking something. </p>

<p>Having said my rant, to answer the specific question (and <strong>tl;dr</strong>), this site can become extremely different from TCS.se if we start asking some relatively elementary questions and not ban a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homework"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;homework&#39;"" rel=""tag"">homework</a> tag. </p>

5,"<p>I asked <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/206/is-an-innite-sequence-of-context-free-languages-context-free"">a question</a> on the main site. One of the users suggested to edit it and delete some parts which are covered by a Wikipedia article. When I did it, one of the answerers complained that by the new version half of his answer is not useful and is irrelevant somehow.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what should I do now and if a part of my question is in a Wikipedia article, does it mean I cannot ask it? I saw <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/151/how-to-determine-if-a-database-schema-violates-one-of-the-less-known-normal-form"">another question</a> which was about definition of some DB expressions and no one complained why you asked an easy question and I didn't think it was easy.</p>

5,"<p>There is no problem with asking questions for which an answer appears in Wikipedia.</p>

Please note that you can look at a question's (or post's) <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/posts/206/revisions"">revision history</a> by clicking on the edit time. As you can see in this case, the OP changed the content of the question, I merely adapted it to use proper notation and notions.</p>

<p>For instance, I replaced $+$ on sets with the proper $\cup$ and changed the title; the phrase ""an infinite sequence of languages is context-free"" just does not make any sense.</p>

<p>This (imho) improving edit was since rolled back by the OP which suggests to me that they do not even recognize proper notation resp. that the question was still equivalent, which in turn means the OP did not research the topic at all before asking.</p>

<p>In general, questions that ask for <em>facts</em> that can easily be found (e.g. on Wikipedia) are not useful on our site. Questions that ask for <em>explanation</em> of something that can easily be found can be great; after all, Wikipedia articles often lack precision and rigor.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>My personal reason for being quite active in this private beta is that I'd like to answer people's questions and help them in understanding Computer Science. I can't really do that on TCS, as the general level is too high (and my specialization, parsing, doesn't really come up that often).</p>

<p>Glancing at the list of questions so far, the list of users and their backgrounds, my guess is that a lot of people are here for the same reason. There are also people who already have questions or think they will have questions in the future, but I think nearly all of our current users are here for the long run: they don't visit this place because (using an SO example) there is some bug in their code that they can't figure out <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>I've tried, but I can't easily come up with questions that are 'lower level' or rather, have a short answer, that I'd be actually interested in knowing the answer to, and to which I can't find the answer myself. Questions I'm interested in (just look at the questions I asked on TCS) usually turn out to be open research questions.</p>

<p>As an example, the question '<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/109/are-there-inherently-ambiguous-and-deterministic-context-free-languages"">Are there inherently ambiguous and deterministic context-free languages?</a>' is a question that is quite a natural and good one, but is also one I wouldn't even dream about asking as I already know the answer is 'no way'.</p>

<p>My guess is that quite a few people on the site have the same issues. This results in the 'higher level' questions that we've seen so far.</p>

<p>This can turn out to be a good thing: it means we have at least a few experts capable of answering the questions that we'll get when we get out of private beta. I guess we'll just have to see what's going to happen when we get to that stage.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I'm not sure if the current set of questions will be an accurate reflection of the questions that are going to be asked when we get out of private beta.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I'm wondering how long typically the private beta period will last? I could not find info on the cs.SE/FAQ (or maybe I missed it).</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Private betas are evaluated after 7 days. Most become public betas at that point. Sometimes, a private beta that hasn't had enough traffic or that's perceived as low quality might be told to shape up and given an extra period of time to improve.</p>

<p>I must say I'm a bit concerned that our beta is too slow. While there aren't any hard-and-fast rules, we only have 60 questions after 5 days. Even <a href=""https://french.stackexchange.com/"">French</a>, where traffic later dwindled to a trickle, had 125 questions in its 7-day private beta. 16 unanswered questions is another concern; many of these are difficult questions, but it does mean we really need to work on recruiting experts on a broad range of fields.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>(Involvement notice: I edited one of your posts.)</p>

<p>There are many different points in your meta question, I'll try to address them all.</p>

<p>I don't think any of the edits on your posts were unnecessary. Keep in mind that on Stack Exchange, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/faq#editing"">other users can edit your posts, and this is very much by design</a>. Once you've posted a question, it belongs to you and to the community. In a private beta, most involved users read every post, and you can count on a lot of scrutiny. The people who edit your questions are trying to help by improving the way your questions are formulated, formatted or classified; this will help you get better answers.</p>

<p>In the question you linked, if I follow correctly, there were two edits, one done by you at the request of Raphael and one done by Raphael himself.</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't see anything objectionable in Raphael's edit. He improved the title and the formatting of mathematical notations. I don't understand why you rolled it back.</li>
<li><p>The second part of your question, “Does the properties of regular languages (closed under intersection, concatenation, etc.) apply on context free languages as well?”, is rather broad, and it is covered to a large extent by the Wikipedia articles about regular languages and context-free languages. There are several sub-issues here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stack Exchange does not aim to reproduce Wikipedia or other reference sites. There has been some debate in introducing a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/86043/introduce-a-general-reference-close-reason"">general reference close reason</a>. This has only been done on a few sites, mostly because there is a lot of potential for this close reason to be abused. Even if there is no directly associated close reason, you should read the “obvious” Wikipedia article(s) before asking a question. If there's something you don't understand in the article, say that you've read it and tell us what part you didn't undestand.</li>
<li>Each Stack Exchange question is one question. If you have several questions, ask them separately.</li>
<li>The second part of your question was rather broad, and I can see that people may have considered too broad for a Stack Exchange answer.</li>
<li>That being said, I would have interpreted that second part as a follow-up to the first part, and not as a complete question on its own. That is, rather than delete it, I think it would have been better to restrict it to the operation you considered in your main question, i.e. the union.</li>
<li>In general, you should not make substantial edits to a question after posting it, especially if it invalidates existing answers. However, if the question is not suitable in its present form, this takes precedence: if you've asked two questions in one and different people have answered different parts, then

<ul>
<li>this shows why you should not ask two questions in one;</li>
<li>you should do your best to make your question suitable, and if you can't do it without invalidating an existing answer, try to cause the least harm.</li>

It seems both question already had close votes, which is why I think they ended up getting closed.</p>

<p>My guess is that the SE Network has decided to do this to help communities in private beta to get enough close votes on questions that should be closed? If so, is this policy documented anywhere?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Yes, it is normal. And no, it's not so much to ""help them get enough close votes"" - it's to make sure that any problems with questions in the early beta period get discussed. </p>

<p>Remember, when this site exits private beta, the questions that have been asked, and the discussions here on Meta are what set the tone and define the scope for new users entering the site.</p>

<p><strong>Questions that are borderline on-topic, poorly-asked, unclear, or suffering from other issues <em>must</em> go through this process in order for the site to launch with clear guidelines on what questions should be asked and how they should be presented.</strong></p>

<p>In the specific cases you cite, both of those questions had had concerns raised that had not been sufficiently addressed by the authors or others. So they were closed in order to prompt either discussion or revisions. There are other outstanding close votes on questions that <em>have</em> been thoroughly discussed and addressed; whether or not these are closed is up to the rest of the community.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I don't know about the type checking question (148), but the SQL question (135) should not have been closed. <em>One</em> user expressed they did not like the question whereas at least <em>eight</em> liked it enough to upvote. Kaveh gave sufficient reason why his question should remain open, but this explanation was ignored.</p>

<p>I wonder: do the community mods who monitor here have expertise in computer science? If not, I wonder how they can judge the value of a question. Closing anything with a close vote on it is a poor strategy.</p>

<p>I am not sure closing is a good method to prompt OPs to adapt their question; closing seems harsh, and we know that few users read FAQs right away. Maybe a private message or a comment would be better suited to ask users to adapt their questions in a friendly way?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>It is normal for the Stack Exchange team to intervene when they feel that the community is behaving in a way that is detrimental to its survival. Their actions can be reverted by the community, preferably after discussion (the kind that is happening here — prompted by the closures, as it happens).</p>

<p>Speaking of these two closures in particular, <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/98/39"">Shog9</a>'s answer explains why they happened. I'll give my opinion on the two questions in question:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/135/extension-of-sql-capturing-mathsfp"">Extension of SQL capturing $\mathsf{P}$</a>: I think this is a reasonable question; it is outside my area of expertise, but I do not doubt that it makes sense as is to experts. However, the very existence of the comment thread shows that the question needs clarification (if only to avoid attracting wrong answers from readers who misunderstand the question because they lack the necessary prerequisites). I'm not familiar enough with the material to edit myself, but I would vote to reopen if a short explanation or a pointer to what “capture” means in this context and what qualifies as a query language.</li>
<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/148/type-checking-algorithms"">Type-checking algorithms</a>: As I wrote in a comment, I find this question far too broad; type-checking in the three languages cited as examples (C++, Java, Scala) is very different. I would reopen the question if it either focused on one of these languages, or gave some overview of the kind of language that the asker wants to typecheck. I cannot improve the question myself since I don't know what the asker is after.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please remember that closing a question means that it is not suitable <strong>in its present form</strong>. A question can be reopened if it is edited, and this is what I expect to happen in both cases here. The normal workflow is to vote to close and later reopen, <em>especially</em> in the private beta when everyone can vote and questions are subject to especially high scrutiny and high standards. I recommend reading:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/98022/how-soon-should-i-vote-to-close"">How soon should I “vote to close”?</a></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Not everyone agrees with the premise that StackOverflow is exemplary and that all other sides should follow its model. I find its huge volume of traffic exhausting and daunting. It is too fast-paced for my taste. Questions are asked, very quickly answered, and then forgotten. It might work fairly well for technical programming-related questions, but it is not necessarily a model that I would like to try with theoretical research problems. I think that reasonably low volume is an important feature of this site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While perhaps not stated in such plain language elsewhere, this seems to be the underlying theme of most answers there, and it represents a division of philosophy that arose in the SE 1.0 era (beginning with Stack Overflow) and has now been replicated and expanded on the SE 2.0 sites. There are a number of ways to describe this division, but for the purpose of this discussion I'm going to use a question...</p>
<h3>Is a lack of existing knowledge of the field an insurmountable barrier to entry?</h3>
<p>Stack Overflow espouses an open-arms approach: show up, ask your question, and as long as it's about programming - an extremely broad field - you'll get an answer. Doesn't matter if it's answered on page one, chapter one of <em>Learn 2 Program in 10 Hours</em> - they won't turn you away.</p>
<p>Theoretical Computer Science takes the opposite approach. Your question must be related to theoretical computer science - an already very narrow field. But it must also be a <em>research-level question.</em> From the FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be &quot;research-level&quot; roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.'s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student. It does not include questions at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate course/textbook homework/exercise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The big tent</h3>
<p>In practice, there <em>are</em> questions that are considered &quot;too basic&quot; for Stack Overflow. But this inclusionist philosophy has had a <em>massive</em> influence on its reach and scope: by demanding little-to-no background from askers in <em>any</em> topic, SO has been able to serve a staggeringly broad base of users from different backgrounds, many of them experts in their own right but in fields that have only a tangential connection to programming.</p>
<p><strong>But even more importantly</strong>, this broad scope encourages the collaborative construction of a library of knowledge useful to many who may never actively participate on the site. This was <em>not</em> accidental. And the success of this philosophy in achieving this goal is reflected in the numbers: 96% of visitors to the site do so because their question shows up in a Google (or other general-purpose search engine) search result. Network-wide, that number is about 87%. The vast, vast majority of people learning from the answers on these sites will never need to even sign in.</p>
<p>Oh... And on CSTheory? That number hovers between 40% and 50%.</p>
<h3>The mailing list</h3>
<p>This brings me back to Jukka's answer (quoted in part above). Even though the Stack Exchange software seems to be working fairly well for that community, this is <em>mostly accidental</em> - it was never designed for small, low-traffic, mostly self-contained groups of people. You can actually license the system for use on private, internal sites, but very, very few groups ever do this: not many internal organizations reach the scale necessary for it to actually <em>work</em>.</p>
<p>Indeed, CSTheory is more akin to a large mailing list or message board than it is to the sort of Q&amp;A repository Stack Exchange was designed for. That it works <em>at all</em>, and has managed to establish and sustain a core group of users, is actually quite fascinating. I feel strongly that there are lessons we can learn from it and apply to other topics within our network.</p>
<p>That said, I must <em>strongly</em> caution you against attempting to replicate that philosophy <strong>here</strong>.</p>
<h3>We're not in the mailing list business</h3>
<p>Please let me be frank with you: this network - which is to say, the people who comprise it, not the organization funding it - <em>cannot support</em> a dozen sites like CSTheory, now or in the near future. And I have no desire to shut this site down, followed one after another by each of the dozen or so related proposals for niche sites. But if each one insists on trying to follow this mailing-list pattern, that is <em>exactly</em> what will happen. That's <em>not</em> a threat - it's a prediction.</p>
<p>So to finally answer the question, <em>this</em> is what you can do to make your community different from that on CSTheory:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Welcome beginners</strong>
Computer science is a fairly large field, and folks approach it from many directions. Some make it their field of study; others make it their livelihood. Many will encounter it as part of their work or study in some other field. Don't turn them away.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Welcome closely-related topics</strong>
Don't worry too much if a particular question seems like it's focused more on mathematics, or software engineering, or statistics. If it can be asked and answered from a CS perspective, then edit to make that clear... and then answer it. I would much rather see this site encompass topics like artificial intelligence or even computational linguistics than try to spin up separate sites. Be very careful when defining your scope to be <em>as inclusive as possible</em> without <em>completely</em> abandoning CS as the focus.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strive for accessible language in questions and answers</strong>
Every question need not devolve into a beginner's tutorial on the basic concepts. But questions and answers will be far more useful as a resource for others when they're written (or edited) with that in mind. Avoid ambiguity, embrace detail, and welcome questions from those unfamiliar with your particular area of interest as an opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be patient with students</strong>
I have a sneaking suspicion that the primary audience for this site - initially at least - <em>will</em> be students, from many different backgrounds and at many different points in their education. This is a wonderful opportunity, but it can also be a burden: students are often poor at asking questions, may lack sufficient background to even know quite what they're asking, and can be tempted to misuse the site as a resource for cheating rather than learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't promise a happy outcome, even if you follow these guidelines. As some of you may know, I was quite reluctant to see this site launch in the first place, and I still harbor grave doubts as to whether it can be made to work. But after much discussion, in public and internally, we decided to give it a chance.</p>
<p>All I can ask is that you do the same...</p>

5,"<blockquote>
  <p>More elementary questions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked a question here on meta about stocking the site with frequently-asked questions on introductory material, to which we could provide very strong answers before the public beta. The answer was that we should not ask elementary questions just to stock the beta, so I have not been doing that, although I think there could be a lot of value in it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More advanced questions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel like we're getting plenty of ""advanced"" questions, no more are required. We are going to want to attract lots of people, lots of good answers, lots of votes, and asking purposefully difficult questions is not going to help that. It doesn't help that a lot of questions in CS have as their best answer ""nobody knows"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More varied questions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been trying this, and the questions seem to get a good number of votes and in some cases attract some discussion... so this might be a good way to go. Surely more variety will attract a wider user base, get more people involved, and (very importantly) help to solidify the scope of the site. I say yes to this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More users to provide questions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I definitely feel like this one is important. It seems obvious to me that avid users, who want to see this site turn into anything, should be asking at least as many questions as they provide answers. More good questions will attract more good users and help solidify the site's scope; good answers might keep experts away (why compete for rep when a few people are scrambling to get all the votes on a few questions) and I doubt it would attract a lot of novices (who are more likely to be drive-by posters, if CS.SE becomes anything like SO). I say yes to this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More answers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asking more questions will lead to more answers as well, without (necessarily) increasing the fraction of bad answers, which would probably increase if we were to just give more (arbitrary) answers for each question. Not a fan.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Better answers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Better questions will naturally lead to better answers. We need to focus on asking a bunch of good questions in a variety of areas, and answers will increase in quantity and (possibly) quality as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More users to provide answers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above.</p>

<p>It could be useful for avid users to ask easy questions with no intention to answer each other's questions. This might attract users who aren't as interested (currently) by making it possible to get more points, since they won't have to compete with avid (and, one would assume, generally somewhat well-qualified) users. This might be counter to the whole Q&amp;A thing that SE does, but it might be a (temporary) sacrifice worth making. An implementation that might work is to just put a hold on users above a certain rep (200? 500? 1000?) from answering any question which hasn't been around for two days.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I foresee a number of topics that will probably come up again and again on this site in the future. As one has already been asked, I think we may want to come up with a policy for these types of topics while we're still in beta.</p>

<p>The topic in question is 'how to determine the running time of an algorithm', asked <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/192/how-to-come-up-with-the-runtime-of-algorithms"">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is a very fundamental question to CS; it is one of the basic topis that comes up again and again. However, the question asked there is also very broad: a proper answer would be quite long, as it would essentially contain several lectures' worth of information.</p>

<p>I don't see any easy way of constraining the question such that it becomes answerable with a shorter answer - note that the question 'what is the running time of this algorithm' is a different kind of question, though very closely related: the first asks about techniques, the second about a single answer.</p>

<p>Another one will be 'how does big-oh notation work?', 'how can I write my own compiler?', and others I can't think of right now.</p>

<p>I see two ways to deal with these kinds of questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Shoot them down on sight. Questions that are too broad like this will be closed (I think as 'not a real question', but I could be wrong). The reasoning would be 'these questions are too broad, you may be better off taking a course somewhere'.</li>
<li>Have a single question with one (or more) big answers, giving a lot of information about the subject. Close all other questions that will pop up as duplicates of the first one, and hope that people visit the linked question and either get their answer there, or be provided with enough information to ask a directed, narrower question.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are already plenty of example of type 2 Q&amp;A pairs, such as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/plain-english-explanation-of-big-o"">this one</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide"">this one</a>, but there are many more. Another good example is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/247621/what-are-the-correct-version-numbers-for-c"">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Which option is preferable? Is there an option 3? Am I predicting this completely wrong?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>We have two tags at the moment which seem to be the same topic. I think we should make one the synonym for the other. So my suggestion is to merge <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/formal-grammars"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;formal-grammars&#39;"" rel=""tag"">formal-grammars</a> into <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/grammars"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;grammars&#39;"" rel=""tag"">grammars</a>.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>This kind of question and answer pair is known as a “canonical Q&amp;A”. The subject has been <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/search?q=%2Bcanonical"">discussed on the main Meta</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, these questions arise after many similar questions have been posted. It is far better to write them with the benefit of experience. Without this benefit, it's very hard to aim for the right audience, for the right level of detail.</p>

<p>If a question arises naturally, it's a different matter. Take them as they come! What I don't recommend is to try to create such questions yourself.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I'm going to go out on a limb here a bit and suggest that you <em>do</em> try to ""stock the site"" during the next week of the private beta, with questions that represent a reasonable cross-section of what a CS site might be expected to cover on Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>Please keep the following in mind when doing so:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You should at least have an interest in the topic sufficient to recognize and encourage high-quality answers. </p></li>
<li><p>You can look to other sites on the network (and proposals on Area51) for CS questions that are poorly served or off-topic, but don't copy them verbatim - ask clearly, and with an explicit CS focus.</p></li>
<li><p>A few good beginner and intermediate-level questions are useful as examples to actual beginner and intermediate users. Don't try to fake it though - use questions from students you know, or your own past.</p></li>
<li><p>Applied CS should be a goldmine for questions that will give the site more breadth without sacrificing quality. If you can encourage these early on, there are a bunch of folks currently waiting on their own proposed sites who could join you here.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, the goal here isn't to pad out the numbers - it's to have a site that appears as full and welcoming as possible when it goes public. Cherry-picking ""easy"" questions won't accomplish this, but that doesn't mean you can't - or shouldn't - ""stock"" the site with exemplary questions.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>It was bound to happen and thankfully, it did now rather than later: we received the first <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/305/98"">question</a> about a claim regarding P?=NP.</p>

<p>Some topics, in particular this, attract lots of public attention and laymen research. I do not want to belittle such efforts, but according to experts (i.e. complexity theory researchers) most of them are no good at all and in total, the signal to noise ratio is small.</p>

<p>How do we deal with such questions? As we generally allow questions of the form ""Please help me understand X!"" (or so I believe) this can not be the angle. Should we discourage people to ask questions about stuff that is likely to be cranky, or do we rather take the opportunity to educate people about how to tell ""good"" from ""bad"" work?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Here's the policy I would favor. I'm open to being contradicted if you've had experiences on other sites (<a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/"">Theoretical Computer Science</a>, <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/"">Math</a>, <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/"">Physics</a>, …) that show that this policy is not viable.</p>

<p>Questions like “Is this proof correct?” or “I'm sure this proof is wrong but what's the fallacy?” or similar variants should be closed as “not a real question”, because they are <em>overly broad</em> (or worse, <em>rhetorical</em> like “I challenge you to find a fallacy”). You can't expect a review of a proof of anything more than a few clearly written lines in a Stack Exchange answer. Favorite crank topics can be held to a particularly high standard.</p>

<p>Unclear problems should be closed as “not a real question” too (<em>ambiguous, vague, incomplete</em>). If someone who's reasonably versed in the domain of the question cannot determine the precise statement of the problem from the question, close. Again, favorite crank topics can be held to a particularly high standard.</p>

<p>On the other hands, questions like “Is [clearly stated problem] in P” are valid questions. I don't see any grounds to refuse them. Again, the more the topic attracts cranks, the more precision and clarity should be required. If that problem is a variation on some well-known NP-complete problem, the answer “here is why this problem is NP-complete, and it is a well-known open problem whether it is in P” is a perfectly acceptable answer. If the question calls for more than that, close as “not a real question” (<em>overly broad</em>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, we need to be careful not to encourage copycats. This means quickly closing “dodgy” questions, and subsequently deleting them unless salvaged. Also, borderline questions should be edited to deemphasize the crank relationship.</p>

<p>With regards to <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/305/whats-wrong-in-this-article-claming-p-np"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/305/whats-wrong-in-this-article-claming-p-np</a>, I have voted to close as “not a real question”. I left the following comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are claiming that some variation of a well-known NP-complete problem is in P. This is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcello_Truzzi#.22Extraordinary_claims.22"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary evidence</a>. Some random article found on the web does not constitute extraordinary evidence. Therefore I am voting to close this question as overly broad; it is not our goal here to make broad advances to science in a single post.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I don’t think that in-depth reviews of whole articles (10 pages in this case) are in the scope of CS.SE. If the author submits his work the usual publishing routine will perhaps produce some reviews.</p>

<p>Now, if a third person has a question about such an article it should be specific and narrow. For example something along the lines: “The author has defined X, but in his first lemma where he uses X, I think he is not following his own definition?” The question should show that the inquirer has at least made some effort himself towards answering the question. Asking for the typical gaps (“it is easily verified that Y holds.”) in a proof are valid questions, however the inquirer should include what he himself got so far. On TeX.SE people are usually asked to provide a “minimum failing example” so the community has a quick starting point for examining the problem at hand.</p>

<p>Just pointing to a result an asking whether it is true or not is simply to broad. Something like “Maybe here is a problem?” is incomplete as the inquirer should at least state where his suspicion comes from.</p>

<p>For example in <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/307/context-freeness-of-certain-language"">question</a> it is not clear what has been tried so far by the inquirer. For my taste just stating “I was unable to find a proof of the fact.” could at least include where he has looked at so far (Hopcroft &amp; Ullman?, Harrison?, Salomaa?). (Then I don’t have to go through this again. It’s a courtsey towards the person taking their time to provide an answer.)</p>

5,"<p>This question related to writing titles and editing posts. It is well-understood that titles should be expressive and tell about the content of the post, i.e., about the specific question being asked.

<p>While it's true that private betas generally need to be stocked with difficult questions aimed at experts, our site is somewhat unusually facing the opposite problem: the dominant level is perceived as too advanced for a part of the intended audience. We need entry-level questions as well.</p>

<p>Your question is a basic, but valid question. I find the comment “Maybe seed the site with less trivial questions” out of line, considering what the site needs right now.</p>

<p>I also disagree with the comment that states that “a thorough answer to your question is already available on the web” with the implication that this makes the question unfit for the site. This is not a research-level site; while questions duplicating Wikipedia or other <em>reference</em> Internet site to not make the Internet better, duplicating content from some random homepage, be it the homepage of a respected CS professor, is useful.

5,"<p>I agree, but I think we should also be careful when posting seeding questions. It seems to me the only requirement we drop for a seeding question is that we already know the answer.

",CSmeta
5,"<p>In this particular instance, I don't think the algorithms tag is appropriate. The reason here is simple: the author didn't ask about an algorithm. Sure, the question is probably one arising in the analysis of algorithms, but that doesn't change the nature of the question. Let me provide an example from another field.</p>

<p>Say that a well-meaning student asks, on the physics site, how one might go about converting a set of differential equations into an equivalent set of integral equations. These happen to be Maxwell's equations and, naturally, everybody recognizes them as such. Should the question be retagged to indicate the relationship to electricity and magnetism?</p>

<p>In light of this example, I have another suggestion entirely: not only was the retagging inappropriate, but the question might not even be a question about computer science. Indeed, this - and the example involving Maxwell's equations - are questions about mathematics. The plot thickens.</p>

<p>I am not necessarily suggesting that questions involving the use of mathematics be removed from this site; that would be a disaster. Certainly many people here are qualified to answer questions like that, and in a sense, a lot of the content we can ask (and have been asking) here is a kind of mathematics. I believe that a good solution might be to introduce a mathematical-methods tag, or similar, for situations such as this. Questions about solving equations, proof techniques, etc. which would find application in solving computer science problems could be assigned this tag.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I'm not even sure that algorithm-analysis would be a fair tag for that question; the author doesn't even use the word algorithm. It's just a question about working with Landau notation.</p>

5,"<p>@Patrick87 proposed the concept of heap automata (<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/110/"">here</a>) which has lead to three follow-up questions (<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/393/"">1</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/390/"">2</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/394/"">3</a>) so far. It is not unlikely that more will follow.</p>

<p>Should we create a tag <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heap-automata"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;heap-automata&#39;"" rel=""tag"">heap-automata</a> in this case? As far as I know, the concept is novel so there is no common association; the tag would only be used to string these questions together.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Since the concept of heap automata isn't really canonical, I'd be wary of introducing one just for this example. I mean, that seems even more problematic than adding a separate tag for each algorithm or data structure.</p>

<p>Perhaps what would be more appropriate would be a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/series"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;series&#39;"" rel=""tag"">series</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/series-of-questions"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;series-of-questions&#39;"" rel=""tag"">series-of-questions</a>, or <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/follow-up"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;follow-up&#39;"" rel=""tag"">follow-up</a> tag, for the more general case of somebody asking a question, getting an answer, and asking a closely-related question. This can happen pretty generally, and would probably make more clear the fact that the discussion is carried over from another question (which a plethora of specific tags might not make clear).</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>As long as Patrick87 links the questions together, which he has, I think this is sufficient. Unless/until heap automata become a revolutionary new concept, it's a good idea to keep the tags as general as possible, so no [heap-automata] tag. Tags such as <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/series"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;series&#39;"" rel=""tag"">series</a> etc do not make sense in isolation, outside of the specific question, so I don't see how they will be useful.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I wanted to offer some thoughts as a user who committed but has not posted to the site yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More varied questions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I originally committed to the proposal, it had the description in <a href=""https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4226/computer-science-the-audience-description-is-now-wrong"">this Area 51 Discuss question</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""for computer Science practitioners, researchers, and CS students interested in topics like theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, programming language design, digital logic, or any other area of CS not directly related to programming.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand why it was changed, but it seems as though that spirit of diversification has been dropped.  I'm not a computer scientist, I've never even played one on TV, but I enjoy the subject, and would like to learn more.  However, I see what seems to be a lot of highly abstract algorithm-related questions, and to my untrained eye, this seems to bear a lot more resemblance to CSTheory than not.  I understand enough about the politics to know that many of them aren't ""research level"" and, therefore, are off topic there.</p>

<p>Perhaps that somewhat more recent incarnation of the description which included more applied questions (that I latched onto) was falling away from the original aim of the site (which was perhaps a more undergraduate friendly collective for theory  -- CS is a science after all, and I have no problem with that!), and it has been brought back to that point.  If that's the case, then I don't think this is the site for me.  I will probably muster up a few questions (I'm following the Coursera algorithms class), but I'm also happy to stand on the sidelines and cheer, vote, edit, etc. to get this moving, as I know that it is exactly what others want.</p>

5,"<p><a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/"">Real questions have answers, not items</a>. Reading lists don't work well in the questions and answers format of Stack Exchange. With one item per answer, you end up with voting that combines how old an answer is (utterly useless), how popular it is (mostly useless), and how good and relevant it is (if you're lucky). Your proposal removes the impact of age, but it requires heavy duty maintenance: we'd have to watch every list question, check how the voting goes; and in the meantime we have this jumble of answers (many of which will be in the provisional stage for a very long time).</p>

<p>For book lists covering a topic, we have a place: the tag wiki. There is a Stack Exchange-wide move to put book lists in tag wikis, and better support for large tag wikis is in the plans.</p>

<p>Other book questions may be acceptable, but only if they call for useful answers. That is:</p>

<ul>
<li>The question should express a specific need. Not “all the books/the best books on topic X”, but “I want to study X, what combination of books/articles would give me good coverage?” — where X is narrower than a whole sub-discipline.</li>
<li>Answers should strive for completeness: never give a single item unless you claim that this single item is sufficient in and of itself. An answer that adds just one book as a complement should be an edit to an existing answer or a comment.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend reading the <a href=""https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/203/policy-trial-notice-book-recommendations"">Literature Stack Exchange book recommendation policy</a> (which kinda works, but still lets a lot of mediocre questions with mediocre answers in) and the <a href=""https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2003/are-book-recommendations-on-topic"">Programmers Stack Exchange book recommendation policy</a> (which… well, it's Prog.SE).</p>

<p><a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/"">Community wiki</a> is not an excuse for bad questions. If the question is good, it doesn't need CW. If the question is bad, CW won't redeem it, it needs to be closed.</p>

<p>We don't need to tag these questions specially. If the question is good, it doesn't need to be ghettoized. If the question is bad, a tag won't redeem it.</p>

<p>Regarding this specific question, I initially voted to close, but I've halfway reconsidered. I think it may be barely ok. The good thing is that it calls for a limited syllabus (we're not going to recommend 100 books). On the other hand there are already 6 answers, of which only <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/456"">1</a><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/466"">½</a> really address the question; the other answers just take this opportunity to mention their favorite books. Furthermore, the lack of a tag (no, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/soft-question"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;soft-question&#39;"" rel=""tag"">soft-question</a> is <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/80/a-hard-stance-against-the-soft-question-tag"">not a suitable tag</a>) is a bad sign.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>In the light of this discussion, this is what I propose to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask users to propose <strong>only one book per answer</strong>.<br>
<em>Rationale:</em> Votes should reflect wether books should go into the main answer. Having only one book per answer simplifies that.</li>
<li>Create <strong>one CW answer</strong> (per field (algorithms, mathematical foundations, logics, languages &amp; automata) if the list becomes long).<br>
<em>Rationale:</em> CW because there should be no credit where none is due. </li>
<li><strong>Incorporate all answers with score at least five</strong> and <strong>ask the users to remove their answers.</strong><br>
<em>Rationale:</em> One central list with good books is better than redundant, scattered information. Removing incorporated answers keeps the thread clean.</li>
<li><strong>Remove answers that do not reach score 5 after two weeks</strong>.<br>
<em>Rationale:</em> Keeping the thread clean.</li>

5,"<p>I think the <em>sum</em> of all tags should define a question; it is not per se necessary that any given tag applies only to questions of the same kind.

<p>Additionally, I think we can even gain something when tags overlap subfields: people interested in one can see connections to another they previously were not aware of. If we cage tags into subfields, we can not hope to map the bigger picture in CS to tags. As a special case, applications are tied to the underlying theory.</p>

5,"<p>I like to quote the tooltips of the UP- and DOWN-vote buttons here:</p>

<p>UP: “This question shows research effort; ...”</p>

<p>DOWN: “This question doesn not show any research effort; ...”</p>

<p>I interpret “research effort” not in terms of science, but simply that the person who is asking should state what he has tried so far and with what success.</p>

<p>I am not happy about the “riddle-type” seeding question because they omit that part, for not giving away the riddle’s solution. For example this <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/332/in-place-algorithm-for-interleaving-an-array"">question</a>, like some others, just asks for the solution, without telling what the inquirer has tried himself.</p>

<p>I am also not happy with the broad “tell my a bit about that topic”-type questions. An example is this <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/539/visual-programming-languages"">one</a>. Again it lacks any own research effort and is too broad, IMHO.
Should we be stricter about the questions an try to avoid ones that are rather unspecific and not narrow?</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>First of all, as you mention many questions have been seeding questions so far. Should we invent stuff just to make it real? I don't think so. This should end soon, though.</p>

<p>Secondly, upvoting constitutes more for me than just research effort. The question has to be ontopic, of general interest, well-posed, clear, unsuggestive, ... I won't vote down if any single one of those criteria is not met. If the unfulfilled become more, I won't vote and comment my concerns. Only if many aspects are amiss will I vote down.</p>

<p>Bottom-line, showing effort is one (important) aspect of a good question, but if it is absent the question is not necessarily bad. It is always fair to ask the OP before answering.</p>

5,"<p>I'm against the homework tag. As with any of the best answers I've seen on theory questions on any stackexchange site, we should answer questions in a way that leads someone to the answer when the question is the foundation of a science. There is no time that foundational questions like these should either be ignored or answered fully. Regardless if someone is asking for graded homework or for their review. Giving them the answer straight is not beneficial because of the nature of these types of questions.</p>

<p><strong>Preface</strong></p>

<p>The only questions so far that I've asked are homework so here are my thoughts. When I ask a question on here, I don't want the direct solution. </p>

<p>This only applies to the core parts of computer science like with my example:</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/618/where-in-the-chomsky-hierarchy-does-this-language-fit"">Where in the Chomsky hierarchy does this language fit?</a></p>

<p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>

<p>In my mind, there should be no differentiation between someone asking for homework and someone asking for their benefit. <strong>If I put the homework tag, I am inherently asking for members to ignore my question, even though I'm stating that I am not trying to cheat.</strong> If the members of this site instead look at each question on the foundations of computer science as the asker is trying to learn and not cheat or be lazy we can fulfill our user's want to not help someone cheat and the students want for some help on their homework.</p>

<p>In my question that I put as an example, this <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/621/596"">answer</a> was a really good example of how foundational questions should be answered regardless if the asker is doing homework. You can lead them in the right direction while still making sure they get the purpose of their homework, which is to further their understanding. An answer that furthers my understanding, regardless if I'm getting a grade, is the best answer and should be the norm here IMO.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>From a current discussion in chat, the following proposal has emerged:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get rid of the homework tag. We do not want discrimination based on the origin of a question, nor do we feel responsible for students that want to go the easy way.</li>
<li>If the asker wants to be treated with hints instead of answers, they should state so clearly, e.g. “How do I get started with this problem?” as opposed to “What's the result?”</li>
<li>Answerers should respect this wish. They should, however, still give a full answer using spoiler markdown (for future reference; <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/610/98"">example</a>) if it makes sense. </li>

<p>After talking to <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/240/gilles"">Gilles</a> in chat about possible solutions to the homework tag problem. The tag just-a-hint was suggested. The purpose of just-a-hint would be to include all questions that are students asking homework questions or just a member trying to further their knowledge. In both cases, it's probably better to just give a hint. Those hints would possibly help future members. What are your thoughts?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think this would be a great idea because it would get rid of some of the issues with a homework tag.</p>

<p>I think there shouldn't be a homework tag because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't directly encourage users to ignore the tag, but it tends to get added to the ignore list because some users think the tag means the asker is being lazy.</li>
<li>Members tend to assume that some abstract or foundational questions being asked are homework and thus mark the question as Homework</li>
<li>It's more often than not a subject of debate as to whether or not the asker is lying about it being homework</li>
<li>There seems to be a negative stigma associated with tagging questions as homework on other SE</li>
</ul>

<p>I have no citations for these points and they're mostly subjective, but these are my experiences. </p>

<p>I think if we use just-a-hint as a tag and encourage the asker to use it if they're doing homework we're alleviating a lot of these issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>We no longer argue about if a question is homework. </li>
<li>If an asker refuses to put just-a-hint when it's clearly the homework, it's now the askers prerogative to do so, but members can still choose not to answer when they think it's clear.</li>
<li>The negative stigma is removed from users who are just trying to review their knowledge and aren't asking homework. </li>
</ul>

<p>I'de like to say this doesn't even need a tag and that would be my first choice, but given the way SE sites generally work this will leave ambiguity and the homework tag (or one similar) will be used instead of this. I think this tag would best indicate the purpose of the question without assigning any stigma to it.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think the question is of high quality, it it certainly connected to computers and there is a lot of computer science connected to viruses. However, even if the topic is connected to Computer Science, that doesn't mean every question related to the topic also is.</p>

<p>The first paragraphs describe some business concerns and some IT concerns. The OP mentions two alternatives, the first of which is a user experience question and the second is a legal issue (I'm pretty sure it's illegal). The OP then finishes with a rather broad question.</p>

<p>Even though evidently a lot of people found the question interesting and good (even I thought so), I don't think the question should be on-topic on this site: it may be a very good question on some other Stack Exchange site.</p>

<p>My problem with the question is that there is no 'science' involved. There is no theoretical framework behind the question, but only a question for 'good' uses of viruses. There is no definition of 'good', nor any indication what the OP is looking for.</p>

<p>All the answers talk about ethics, legal issues, networking implementation details, specific flaws that might be exploited and specific things that particular examples of viruses have done in the past, but here again I see no theory or science involved.</p>

<p>Now, this is all according to my personal definition of Computer Science, and I just offer my view on the matter. The scope of the site is far from set in stone right now, so this meta discussion is very useful.</p>

<p>I tried to let the questioner (and answerers) know about this by leaving a comment on the question (though quite terse) which seems to have been ignored mostly (except for one upvote).</p>

Some people feel that this is just pedantic nitpicking (from my past experience on SO), but given that this is a computer science site(and not a programming site, where even basic theory seems to be a second class citizen), we should strive for correctness and avoid making <em>basic</em> mistakes like these if we can.</p>

5,"<p>As I see it, tags have only one meaning: sorting questions by categories. Tags don't and shouldn't change the way the community treats a question. A detailed answer should be provided regardless of the fact it is a homework question. If the OP just wants a hint, that should be specified within the question. If the OP wrote a trivial question, the answer should give a short answer stating this fact (usually with a link to the WP page), or be closed.</p>

<p>With that in mind, the only function that tagging a question serves is a tool to search and sort questions according to their topic. I DO think that the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homework"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;homework&#39;"" rel=""tag"">homework</a> tag is useful, as it allows professors and TAs to go over similar HW questions and get new ideas. It allows student to search for more questions and prepare better before an exam (or just to make sure they understand the material).</p>

<p>The only problem we have with this tag, is that <em>in other communities</em> it is perhaps treated differently (such as: not giving a full answer, etc.).

<p>I don't expect the OP to use this tag, but rather the community to add such a tag to any question that is common for courses in that topic. This might be a bit vague at times, but classification to other tags is not always black-and-white as well.</p>

<p>Second it was a was a good question and was getting good answers anyway, so why close? The reason to close a question as vague or overly broad is because it is hard to tell what is being asked or because the answer may be everything, and this makes the question useless. That types of questions are harmful to stackexchange sites because they tend to create noise. However, that was not the case here. Even if the question was worded as broad, it still was a good question getting good answers, so should not be closed.</p>

<p>If you think the question should be improved, suggest how to do so without creating artificial restrictions and restricting it usefulness just to say that it is not broad anymore.

<p>I'd have to agree with Raphael's answer. For example cache-obliviousness is <em>not</em> about computer architechtures. It is about analyzing algorithms and data structures on a hypothetical, idealized model of computation. In fact, one of the main points about being cache-oblivious is that you don't care or need to know the details of the underlying memory hierarchy. Sizes of the caches etc. can be whatever, they do not affect our asymptotic analysis there. In this sense, my question is not really about real caches or architechtures. They are something more concrete. In this way I also agree with the OP.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I'll summarize what I know. This is tainted by my partial knowledge (I didn't follow everything), my partial memory and my point of view on the subject.</p>

<p>Stack Exchange started out as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a>, a questions and answers site for programmers. It then expanded to cover other subjects. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange_Network"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Wikipedia article</a> for a timeline. When <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/"">Area 51</a> started, allowing anyone to propose a site on any subject, one of the first proposals (back in June 2010) was <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8766?phase=definition"">Theoretical Computer Science</a>. The site was proposed for “research-level questions in theoretical computer science”. After a bit of hesitation, with proposals to drop the restrictions on “research level” and “theoretical” (you'll find some of these on <a href=""https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/"">CSTheory Meta</a>, and indeed you cited one of them), it turned out that the community indeed wanted a site for research-level questions in theoretical science, as proposed, thank you very much.</p>

<p>As there was demand for a site covering the rest of computer science, there were several proposals for such a site on Area 51. I think there were 4, but there may have been more that I never found out about or don't remember. All but the last one which gave rise to this site followed the same path:</p>

<ol>
<li>A proposal is made.</li>
<li>5 people vote to close it.</li>
<li>Before or after the close voted, a <a href=""https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/"">discussion</a> happens about the suitability of the site.</li>
<li>The closed proposal is automatically deleted after a month, as are the associated discussions.</li>
</ol>

<p>As far as I can tell, there were three reasons why people voted to close the CS proposals:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is already a site with “computer science” in the name. Your proposal is an obvious duplicate of this. (<a href=""https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3021/is-computer-science-a-duplicate-of-theoretical-computer-science/3022#3022"">Here</a>'s a typical example; there were many others.) Now that you've pointed out that the site's FAQ says that it's only for research-level questions about theory, I don't care because I disagree with the existence of a site with these restrictions, there should be a more general CS site. Therefore the CS proposal must not be allowed to proceed, and CSTheory must be forcibly expanded.</li>
<li>There is already Stack Overflow, whose <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/faq"">FAQ</a> allows “software algorithm” questions and “practical, answerable problems that are unique to the programming profession”. This clearly makes computer science on-topic on Stack Overflow. For more theoretical questions, there is also <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/"">Math Stack Exchange</a>. If you really think there's more to computer science than algorithm and that theory stuff, there are already many sites about computers: <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/"">IT Security</a>, <a href=""https://superuser.com/"">Super User</a>, <a href=""https://drupal.stackexchange.com/"">Drupal</a>¹, and many more. There is no room for yet another computer-related site.</li>
<li>Since CSTheory caters for researchers, what remains is homework questions from CS students. We don't want a site for homework questions only, and besides Math and Stack Overflow can cover these questions anyway.²</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/80023/where-on-se-to-discuss-computer-science"">Back in February 2011</a>, Jeff Atwood made “there's already CSTheory and we don't like them so we won't allow another site” the official answer. This didn't stop other CS proposals, until one finally succeeded.</p>

<p>As for what this history teaches us, I think it's typical of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the difficulty that computer science has to be recognized as a science. Too many people see “computer” and think spreadsheets and internet and stuff, not science. Mathematicians (and even some computer scientists) look down on computer scientists who pursue less theoretical concerns as inferiors. Non-scientists (e.g. programmers) look down on scientists as ivory tower types, with a simple and firm divide between what programmers do (useful stuff) and what scientists do (useless stuff — all that boring math they crammed down my throat in college).</li>
<li>Area 51 doesn't work so well, and in particular the way the community decides on which proposals are viable is completely broken. I think there's mostly a consensus about that, but nobody knows how to make it work better. It was clear with the CS proposal that the people evaluating it didn't understand what the proposal was about, and often did not act responsibly (not reading the CSTheory FAQ before making up their mind of what the site was about).</li>
</ul>

<p>This was an object lesson for me too, in demonstrating that shouting louder is more important than having good arguments. Eventually the proponents of the CS site formed a small but active lobby while everyone else got tired of the subject. Our challenge now is to regain the interest of the people who might participate on the site.</p>

<p>This is a broad question, asking for an overview of a whole subfield. While the answers do provide some adequate perspectives on the subject, I found them, as a whole, far less informative than <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_prediction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Wikipedia article on the subject</a>. (I pick on this example because I recently learned how a particular processor implements branch prediction; the Wikipedia helped me clarify some points, whereas the CS.SE answers were not helpful.)</p>

<p>This site is not Wikipedia. Wikipedia does a far better job at answering the title question, how branch prediction works. The post has a second part, “Can I optimize my code to help the CPU guess more accurately?” — also too broad, as is apparent in the answers: they only provide tidbits of advice, and none of them addresses the full domain (what to do depends to some extent on the features offered by the CPU, on what the compiler can do for itself, and on what the code does).</p>

<p>Some sites have “<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/86043/introduce-a-general-reference-close-reason"">general reference</a>” as a close reason, for questions that are best looked up in a reference document (encyclopedia, dictionary, user's manual, … — this doesn't include questions where finding the reference is the main problem). This was not generally adopted, and I am not proposing it here, because there is a huge potential for abuse. Nevertheless, I propose the following guideline:</p>

<p><strong>If the question boils down to “what is X”, and there is an adequate Wikipedia article (or other similar reference), then close the question.</strong> “Not a real question” is appropriate for a broad subject where we cannot be expected to write a whole précis in an answer. “Too localized” can also be used, inasmuch as looking up the obvious Wikipedia article is easier than finding the question here, so having the question here hinders future visitors more than it helps them.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think that posting a comment with a link to the relevant Wikipedia article and requesting the user edit the question if there is a more specific issue is fair and reasonable. Failure to ask a more specific question, one way or the other, could then be reasonable grounds for closing and deleting the question as ""overly broad"" or ""it's hard to tell what is being asked"". Anybody who knows enough to ask an on-topic question knows enough to check Wikipedia. </p>

<p>If yes, then feel free to ask it here. For more discussion on that topic, see <em>this question</em> on our meta site.</p>
<p><strong>What is computer science?</strong></p>
<p>Although there is no black-and-white distinction between computer science questions and programming questions, questions are considered to be about &quot;computer science&quot; roughly when they can be discussed between two people who don't know any of the same programming languages or application programming interfaces. For an explanation of what CS is, we refer you to the short definition found in the 2000 article, &quot;Computing as a Discipline,&quot; by Peter J. Denning, Douglas E. Comer, David Gries, Michael C. Mulder, Allen Tucker, A. Joe Turner, and Paul R. Young:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The discipline of computing is the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental question underlying all of computing is, &quot;What can be (efficiently) automated?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that I have not added appropriate links to this, but you should get the idea. I will now try to argue for some of the strengths of this version, compared to Raphael's, the leading contender:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first meaningful point of departure is in the first list: whereas Raphael uses &quot;How to apply those to a given problem&quot;, I give &quot;solving computer science problems,&quot; and &quot;applying computer science to solve problems in other areas.&quot; I feel that using the Mathematics FAQ as a template may have led Raphael astray here. Problems in Mathematics are typically solved using Mathematics only; so it makes sense to limit solutions to mathematical problems to solutions relying on mathematics only. However, Computer Science can (and does) benefit from areas which may not be considered by most people to be part of Computer Science, especially those areas of mathematics which may provide useful tools (e.g., graph theory). My phrasing avoids this difficulty by separating computer science problems (which are of interest primarily to computer scientists, and which may be solved using a variety of tools which are not part of computer science, per se) and problems (of interest primarily to others) to which computer science can be applied (e.g., to design an algorithm to compute some interesting result). In this sense, I feel like CS should feel more like the statistics or physics stack exchange sites, rather than the mathematics site.</p>

<li><p>The next point of departure is in the last point of the first list: whereas Raphael says &quot;History and development of computer science,&quot; I say &quot;issues unique to the discipline of computer science itself.&quot; I feel that this represents a better catch-all than Raphael's version, which implies a scope limited to historical discussions. For instance, that version could be construed as declaring discussions of philosophy, ethics, profession, pedagogy, etc. off-topic; I assume this is not what the community wants? My version allows more, without (in my estimation) allowing too much. Indeed, I raise Raphael's own criticism of the other candidate FAQ against Raphael on this issue: you can never name all of the on-topic, non-technical, about-CS topics; so why list only a few?</p>
</li>
<li><p>I suggest instead of declaring &quot;programming&quot; (the activity) off-topic, we declare &quot;using [...] computer software&quot; (also &quot;using [...] computer hardware&quot;) off-topic. Programming is an activity to which computer science is and should be applied; in the same way that solving a system of equations is an activity to which mathematics is and should be applied. Programming is an activity which virtually all members of this site will have in common. My solution seems more palatable, though still possibly unsatisfactory. Suggestions are appreciated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To avoid questions about personal, academic or professional discussions, which aren't a good fit anyway, I think this is worth stating. I believe we already had a question that would fail this test... could be mistaken.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I have edited my original suggestion to address issues raised in the comments and in the chat discussion. The major change is in how I propose dealing with the &quot;programming&quot; issue. Comments and further suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>A better solution than arbitrarily allowing all programming questions, or arbirarily forbidding all programming questions, might be to add a section to the FAQ explaining the special relationship between programming and computer science. It is common on other sites (such as Theoretical CS and English, for example) to dedicate special sections of the FAQ to delicate matters. I propose that this be done for programming on this site, and the edits reflect that.</p>
<p>The Game Development and Statistics sites do a fairly admirable job of trying to explain what programming questions are on- and off-topic there. Based on their examples, I have crafted the text which appears in the edits.</p>

5,"<p>I have read the FAQ for the main site a few times, both by expanding all sections, and clicking expand all, and yet no badge. This has not been an issue for me on any other SE site (or even this meta site). Any ideas as to what is going on?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Computer Science is the <em>science</em> of <em>computation</em>; that much seems clear. Less clear is how to define <em>science</em> and <em>computation</em> in a useful and meaningful way.</p>

<p>Generally, we might divide <em>science</em> according to two classifications: <em>formal</em> versus <em>empirical</em>, and <em>pure</em> versus <em>applied</em>. Whereas <em>formal science</em> (such as mathematics and much of computer science) relies on deductive reasoning from assumed truths, <em>empirical scienc</em> (such as physics and chemistry) relies on inductive reasoning from observed phenomena. Whereas the goal of <em>pure science</em> is to advance the state of scientific understanding, the goal of <em>applied science</em> is to use such understanding to harness the forces of Nature (in the broadest possible sense of the word) to achieve other goals.</p>

<p>We might define <em>computation</em> as a <em>transformation</em> applied to a piece of <em>information</em>. In the broadest possible sense, <em>computation</em> is, then, any process which causes a change to occur in the universe. There is no need to provide any more detailed definition than this.</p>

<p><em>Computer Science</em>, then, consists of that part of the human endeavor which satisfies the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is science, that is:
<ul>
<li>It is either (1) formal or (2) empirical:
<ol>
<li>employs deductive reasoning from assumed truths</li>
<li>employs inductive reasoning from observed phenomena</li>
</ol></li>
<li>It is either (1) pure or (2) applied
<ol>
<li>seeks to advance the state of scientific understanding</li>
<li>seeks to apply scientific understanding to harness natural forces</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It studies computation, that is:
<ul>
<li>It studies either (1) transformations or (2) information
<ol>
<li>processes which map information from one form to another</li>
<li>entities subject to transformations</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Topics which we might reasonably exclude from <em>Computer Science</em> include that part of the human endeavor which satisfies the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not a science, that is:
<ul>
<li>It contains elements which are neither (1) formal nor (2) empirical:
<ol>
<li>does not employ deductive reasoning from assumed truths</li>
<li>does not employ inductive reasoning from observed phenomena</li>
</ol></li>
<li>It contains elements which are neither (1) pure or (2) applied:
<ol>
<li>it does not seek to advance the state of scientific understanding</li>
<li>it does not seek to apply scientific understanding to harness natural forces</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It does not study computation, that is:
<ul>
<li>It studies subjects which are neither (1) transformations nor (2) information
<ol>
<li>processes which do not map information from one process to another, or for which properties of the mapping are not the focus of discussion</li>
<li>entities not subject to transformations, or for which such properties influencing such transformations are not the focus of discussion</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Comments, edits, and suggestions are welcome. I realize that it is practically impossible to give a universally accepted definition of either science or computation, and as such, I have tried to remain at a high level, possibly to a fault. Also, some of these items must be interpreted broadly (e.g., ""scientific understanding"" is intended to include <em>individual</em> understanding, so that it doesn't require research-level academic questions), while it might be preferable to interpret some of the items more narrowly (for instance, many elementary physics questions can be construed as computation, according to my definition; in a very precise sense, aren't they computation, after all?).</p>

<p>I sincerely encourage others who may better know Alex ten Brink to add additional qualifications and information.</p>

<p><strong>My (Alex') response:</strong> while I'm grateful for the support, there is one reason I'm hesitant to accept this nomination. I have a tendency to take on too many projects at the same time and end up not having enough time for all of them. Right now, my time is pretty well filled; last week for instance I was rather inactive because some deadlines coincided.</p>

<p>I therefore think it'd be better if the position was given to someone else who does have enough and consistent amounts of time to spend on the site. If asked, I'm willing to take the position and spend as much time as I can afford on it, but I can't guarantee consistency. I'll re-evaluate my position if elections are held or a moderator spot opens up - I'm trying to reduce the number of projects I have running at the same time.</p>

<p>This subject came up on <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/"">Programmers</a>, where career questions were on-topic for a long time, and they eventually became seen as <a href=""https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/588/are-career-advice-questions-useful-to-anyone-except-the-poster"">very rarely useful</a> and are now <a href=""https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1165/can-i-ask-career-advice-questions"">banned</a>.</p>

5,"<p>First thank you for creating the Computer Science group. I finally feel at home among all the stack family communities I have seen and participated.</p>

<p>My question is actually somewhat related to <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/121/usage-of-community-wiki"">Usage of Community-wiki</a>, but since I was unsure if it would be appropriate to post it there as an answer I opted for it as a question.</p>

<p>I noticed on other communities that sometimes topics grow related. For example, on Cross Validated there is a section one of the moderators created that had the community listing statistics tool on each answer. This is one type of the grouping I am suggesting and wondering about if this would be allowable here and how one would proceed on doing this (is it only for moderators? are users welcomed to do this? should they have a minimum reputation?)</p>

<p>On the other side I am also considering, say, moderators or users that want to group related knowledge on a single point. For example, again on cross validated there were two questions very similar to each other: Python as a workbench, Excel as a workbench. I end up originating a third: Ruby as a workbench. They are similar, but they are not appropriated as a single question. However, having a grouping question such as 'Workbenchs' and have being listed could be proven helpful. </p>

<p>I didn't notice this yet here since this community is still in its infancy, but questions such like this that thanks to the similar question automatic advice were noticed that could be grouped could maybe help making the CW more usable and easier to browse, avoiding extra redundancy on questions if users would find them easier? </p>

<h3>Addition:</h3>
<p>Above I have argued that there is not a need to have programming questions here, and based on other factors like the intended scope of the site, it is better to leave them out. But
can having programming questions lead to bad things for this site?</p>
<p>I think so: as demonstrated by half a million users of SO, there is a HUGE community of programmers out there with HUGE number of questions, much larger than the computer science questions we will get. By allowing programming questions we face the risk of computer science questions being a negligible portion of the site and turn the site into another version of SO, which would defeat the purpose of the site as a place for computer science questions (and computer scientists would leave also for the same reason that they are not active as computer scientists on SO). Moreover, since SO works very well for programming questions, we are likely to get question with lower quality than SO.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Well, I seem to be the one instigating all of this, so the least I can do is to provide an answer and let the community treat it as it well.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> It depends on the programming question.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> I believe that the best solution is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>simply admit the impossibility of determining, in general, whether a specific programming question will be on- or off-topic;</li>
<li>be as forthcoming as possible about this in the FAQ, and try to provide some general guidelines for programming questions which might be appropriate here;</li>
<li>allow the community to determine on a question-by-question basis what questions do well here, and what questions don't.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several reasons for which I hold this belief:</p>

<ul>
<li>the boundaries and distinctions between various computing fields are likely not as clear as individuals' perceptions thereof, and such perceptions likely vary from individual to individual, making meaningful classification practically impossible;</li>
<li>by making clear the especially delicate nature of the relationship between programming and computer science, interested users (i.e., people who stand a realistic chance of reading the FAQ at some point in time) will be more sensitive to the issue at hand, and be able to make potentially better-informed decisions regarding asking, closing, and reopening questions;</li>
<li>allowing for the possibility of good programming questions might have several benefits for a site such as this, and there seems no reason to believe that the likelihood of the site's benefitting in the long-term from increased traffic, questions, answers, audience, perspectives, etc. is significantly less than the likelihood of the site's being damaged by a large number of poorly-received content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Declaring ""computer programming"" as off-topic unfairly and unproductively excludes a large number of potentially interesting questions and the users who might ask them, receive answers from a computer-science perspective, benefitting both themselves and the community.</p>

<p>Declaring ""computer programming"" as on-topic provides the community with no charter, or mandate, or moral authority to exclude a question only on the basis of its being a programming question, which could make it impossible to meaningfully distinguish this site's scope from a variety of other sites' (Stack Overflow, Programmers, etc.)</p>

<p>The community's reserving the right, without providing a guarantee, to close programming questions as off-topic is both more inclusive than the former solution, and does more to appropriately limit the scope than the latter solution. Where it is weaker than the others is that it does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether any given question will be on-topic.</p>

<p>I believe it is better to be inconclusive all the time, and allow specific circumstances inform the community's decision, than to uniformly (and, in some cases, possibly incorrectly) influence the community's behavior, <em>when it comes to passing judgment on questionable content.</em> If the community doesn't agree that the relationship between programming and computer science is questionable, or debatable, or controversial, that is a separate discussion... and one which could be <em>impossible</em> to satisfactorily resolve.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative</strong></p>

<p>Alternatively, or in addition to the above, the FAQ can attempt to provide a working, or practical, definition of the site's scope, so long as the motivations are made clear in the FAQ (e.g., too much overlap with Stack Overflow, or too much potential for poorly-placed questions, etc.)... so long as the policy which informs and guides the community is accurate (in terms of representing true motivations).</p>

<p><strong>Examples of programming questions which could be considered on-topic</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given this <em>language or formalism</em> implementation of <em>algorithm or process</em>, what is the meaning of <em>part of implementation</em> / what does <em>part of implementation</em> do / why is <em>part of implementation</em> needed / can <em>part of implementation</em> be replaced with <em>part of implementation</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reason: Such questions require (a) the ability to read and understand the syntax and semantics of the <em>language or formalism</em> being used, which might come to bear on any correct answer to the question (of course, it might not!); (b) the ability to read and understand the a*algorithm or process* which the implementation encodes, and what effects on correctness/efficiency/etc. changes to the <em>algorithm or process</em> would have; (c) the ability to relate the ideas of <em>algorithm or process</em> to <em>language or formalism</em>, which is of fundamental importance in computability and complexity (i.e., can you do <em>X</em> in <em>Y</em>, and if so, can you do <em>X</em> in <em>Y</em> with complexity <em>Z</em>?)</p>

<p>More generally,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does <em>definition of computational process or structure</em>, expressed in <em>language or formalism</em>, satisfy the property <em>well-defined property for the indicated language or formalism</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reason: Computer science provides unique tools for analysis and understanding of computational artifacts, allowing (in many, but not necessarily all, cases) for clearly reasoning about characteristics of those artifacts. The <em>language or formalism</em> employed to express those artifacts should not be a primary concern, so long as the the communication to the community is successful, and the artifact/language (or appropriate models thereof) are subject to the tools of computer science.</p>

<p>Note that nobody, including me, is advocating allowing questions that ask for an implementation in a programming language. Those questions should be closed, but for other reasons. Questions which do not show any effort to understand the problem can be closed, for other reasons. Questions which are argumentative or which use a significantly non-standard or incomprehensible notation can be closed, but for other reasons. Otherwise perfectly acceptable questions, for which this community fails to provide a reasonable answer, can be migrated to appropriate sites. It's this last point that presents the only difficulty with my solution: unless SE provides automated means of identifying such questions, it could mean a lot of work for moderators, or questions languishing for a while. Whether this problem would be serious or not is unknown; and in any event, I believe the community could find a way to fix it.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Define programming as the act of writing a program. A programming issue is some issue that prevents you from writing a particular program. An algorithmic issue is a programming issue whose cause lies in the programmer's understanding or knowledge of some algorithm (to the point of not knowing the algorithm at all). I won't attempt to define what is an algorithm and what isn't.</p>

<p>An example of programming is me, trying to get my LR(1) parser generator working before Thursday. An example of a programming issue is the C# compiler crashing when I tried to compile some of my generated C# code that initialized my tables (the tables and therefore the code file was too big). An example of an algorithmic issue is me not knowing how a shift-reduce conflict should be solved if precedences are given and I have multiple conflicts in the same state on the same lookahead.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All programming issues that are not algorithmic issues should be off-topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's really only one <em>good</em> reason for this: a <em>huge</em> part of SO would otherwise become on-topic for this site. Overlap <em>is</em> a good reason to declare a topic off-topic: the reason this site has only come into being a month ago and not years ago is that there was perceived potential overlap with other sites. Feeding that perception by declaring half of SO on-topic is a <em>very bad idea</em>.</p>

<p>The second reason is that programming issues that are not algorithmic issues don't really belong to computer science: a computer scientist shouldn't be interested in all the nitty gritty details of the Real World, as signified by big-oh notation and abstract models of computation. These issues are caused by irrelevant details that can be overcome, and we should therefore not be interested in them from a true Computer Science standpoint.</p>

<p>Note that these 'details' I'm talking about may be very complicated and hard to overcome, but there's no interesting theoretical background to them: details that do have such a background, like IO-efficiency, numerical analysis (finite precision), human-machine interaction, have been formalized and studied as Computer Science, and should therefore be on-topic.</p>

<p>Now, assuming that we indeed make this off-topic, there are two further points to this decision. We need to decide where the line lies, and how to communicate this line.</p>

<p>My proposed criterion is what I already said above: any issue that is algorithmic in nature should be on-topic, everything else is off-topic. It shouldn't matter what programming language is used to <em>communicate</em> the algorithm (issue) in question.</p>

<p>A clearly off-topic question would then be ""What does this piece of Perl code look like in Python?"". An on-topic question would be ""I'm trying to implement an algorithm that uses hashtables in functional programming language X, but it doesn't have hashtables, what should I do?"". An off-topic question would be ""What's wrong with this mergesort implementation"" (assuming the problem is, say, an off-by-one error somewhere).</p>

<p>On how to communicate this line, I'd suggest doing two things: have a vague, understandable rule-of-thumb that errs on the side of on-topicness, along with the exact criterion above. With any luck, the people that aren't sure what their problem is decide to try their luck based on the vague rule-of-thumb, while we still have the exact criterion that empowers us to close questions that are off-topic, without the possibility of a discussion whether that closure was warranted based on the rules.</p>

<hr>

<p>I disagree with closing such questions <em>as off-topic</em>. </p>

<p>First, there aren't arbitrary convention (at least no more arbitrary than conventions in other parts of CS). These standards and conventions are very important in computer networks which are typically defined using RFCs (see this). These RFCs and standards defined in them are essential to computer networks and are part of CS. 
In fact, it shouldn't be difficult to find computer networks tests which ask such questions. There are similar conventions in other parts of CS including theory. Conventions like this are part of CS. </p>

<p>Your opinion that it is not worth knowing is a very personal opinion and IMHO such opinions should not be the base of what is on-topic/off-topic. We never defined the scope as ""things worth knowing"", if the question is in computer science (and I believe it is) then it is on-topic and in scope.</p>

<p>(Obviously closing such questions can be closed for other reasons. E.g. in this case OP hasn't done his part in trying to answer his question since googling will easily lead to the wikipedia article which answers the question, and if we think the OP should at least google and check the relevant wikipedia article then we can close it as say not-constructive.)</p>

5,"<p>I know I <em>hated</em> the policy on cstheory because I felt that (good) questions too basic for the site deserved an answer. This can clearly not be the case here, though; questions we close are (hopefully) clearly offtopic and/or really bad.</p>

<p>Reasons for implementing such a policy:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Protecting our scope</strong> -- If we answer even offtopic/bad questions, we can stop closing altogether. ""But it received a good answer!"" should never be a reason not to close.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong> -- The question might be salvaged, but it might be changed heavily in the process. Existing answers may become invalid.</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring quality</strong> -- The quality measure when formulating a question has to be a YES-answer to ""Is it good?"" and not to ""Can I ask it in such a way and at such a time that I will get an answer before enough close votes?""; we don't want the ensuing races.</li>
<li><strong>Prevent reputation fishing</strong> -- questions about to be closed are obvious target to write a quick and dirty answer that get all (answer) votes this question will ever get. In the worst case, people inclined to write offtopic/bad posts answer each others questions, forming a subcommunity.</li>

<p>Reasons against:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the question turns out to be salvagable or the problem was a misunderstanding, users might be offended.</li>
<li>It is hard to enforce beyond deleting answers.</li>
<li>Especially new users might feel that their contribution is not appreciated.</li>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>So far I don't really see that answers to off topic questions are an issue for this site yet. Most other SE sites (probably around 99%) do not have or needed to discourage users from answering off-topic questions, I don't see why we need it either. </p>

<p>We are also in a better shape than cstheory because most off-topic questions are actually migrate-able if this even becomes an issue, while the same cannot be said about cstheory before cs.SE. Additionally, our set of off-topic questions are considerably smaller compared to cstheory, so it is inherently harder to ask an off-topic question here compared to cstheory. Our site resembles more like 99% of the other SE sites that don't adopt this policy, and cstheory is an exception among all of the SE sites, we are nothing like cstheory except we share some of the same topics.</p>

5,"<p>I don't think “questions about CS-related standards” is a useful classification. Some questions involving standards are on-topic, others are off-topic.

There can be scientific questions about standards; asking why a standard did things the way it did is often on-topic, in that it calls for an analysis of what the possible choices were and what trade-offs mattered. Asking about the behavior of specific implementations of a standard is generally a technological question and not a scientific question; this can venture into science as well, if you're studying compliance or the robustness of the standard, but factual questions about standards are generally best answered by the practitioners who implement them rather than the scientists who make the underlying theoretical designs and experimental studies.</p>

<p>CSTheory.SE is a special case, as it gets many questions that are off-topic solely because hey are too basic, so that the audience would be capable of answering them.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, if you vote to close a question:</p>

<ul>
<li>as duplicate, answer on the duplicate.</li>
<li>as off-topic, don't answer, because the site's audience will not be capable of evaluating your answer. Stack Exchange maintains the quality of its answers by peer review; answers to off-topic questions get no peer review and are therefore automatically suspicious.
<ul>
<li>Exception: if you think the question is likely to be migrated to a site where it will be on-topic, it's ok to answer without waiting; your answer will be evaluated on the target site.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>as non-constructive, don't answer, because non-constructive means that there cannot be a balanced answer, or the risk of provoking arguments is large; answering a non-constructive question defeats the purpose of closing these questions.</li>
<li>as not a real question: the meaning of this close reason is that it is not reasonably possible to answer this question, so answering is logically inconsistent.</li>
<li>as too localized: this is a bit of a special case; I consider it bad form (but might leave a comment).</li>

<p>Furthermore, a tag should not be needed to understand the question. If I ask a question about 'variables', and if the only way to know I'm talking about 3SAT instead of programming languages is through the tags I use, then my question needs to be edited to include what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>The same thing should apply to the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homework"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;homework&#39;"" rel=""tag"">homework</a> tag. If a question is homework or if the user wishes to only get a hint, he needs to say so in his question, and not through his tag use.</p>

<p>To invoke SE policy, the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homework"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;homework&#39;"" rel=""tag"">homework</a> tag is a meta tag: see <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>A <em>separate</em> issue is therefore whether we allow homework <em>questions</em> (rather than the tag), and how we treat them. I think our current (implicit) policy works very well: if the user makes it clear the question is homework, or we guess it is, we provide a hint, along with the full answer in a spoiler tag.</p>

<p>This gives us the best of both worlds: users that only want a hint only get a hint, yet the answer is still there if they get stuck, or if a future visitor is more interested in the answer than how to get to the answer. This also prevents issues if we guess wrong and a question is not homework: the answer will still be there.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I presume this discussion was at least partially occasioned by my recent behavior. I do apologize for what I did -- here is an explanation, not an excuse.  </p>

<p>When I first came on SE it was on the mathematics site. I thought I observed pretty consistent behavior there by those answering -- if it's tagged as homework, just give hints; if it's not so tagged but ""smells"" like homework, many people asked the OP what was up. IOW, the policy seemed consistent, widely practiced and made sense to me, so I adopted it.  </p>

<p>When I later started answering here and in Theoretical CS, I did not stop to determine if the same understanding of the homework tag was well accepted. I did note that quite a few folks were giving full answers to questions that ""smelled"" like homework to me, but I still tried not to do that myself, on the assumption that those folks just hadn't gotten the message.</p>

<p>With the case in question, someone posted a sequence of questions over five days, most of which in retrospect, ""smelled"" at least a bit like homework to me, but which I had been answering in good faith.  In fact, someone actually asked the poster on their first question if it was homework, and <strong>I</strong> chimed in that we should trust them. But as the questions continued to arrive from the same poster, I began to suspect they were indeed homework, and he was hoping to get answers to his assignments. So I asked him after about 3 days, and he replied that it was for a test, not homework. I accepted that for the moment, but as he posted even more questions over a total of five days, I finally got a little snarky, at which point things did blow up. He reiterated his claim that he was studying for a test, so I apologized to him and wished him luck.But he has not reappeared.</p>

<p>So I apologize for getting snarky -- there's never a good excuse for that -- and for transferring my understanding of homework tagging policy to from Math to CS without checking in any way if that was the prevailing norm... and I guess it isn't, at least judging by this thread.</p>

<p>A final note -- IMHO, the way the homework tag is handled in the Math area is good, and I'd like to see the same policy here. But if there is a different understanding or a lack of clear consensus, I will go along with the community, to the extent I can discern what that range of agreed behavior might be.</p>

<p>Actually, one more note. I really should not have gotten snarky even if I was sure the poster was trying to get homework answers to turn in. Such a poster may get away with it for awhile, but it is generally self-limiting in a number of ways. First, if they do it a lot, it will probably raise suspicions here eventually and they will have to stop. Second, a decent teacher should be able to detect when a student's answers suddenly take a leap in accuracy and clarity (assuming we provide those qualities). Lastly, there really is no way to police this and we can't even try to be cops -- we have to have some trust in the honor systems of posters' schools, and if those don't work, it's not our job to put them straight.</p>

<p>All this is complicated for me by the fact that I am a former teacher, though from a time before academic dishonesty became as widespread as I gather it is today. Plus, I was pretty sensitive to dishonesty, and went through a number of serious and sometimes harrowing cases of cheating, whose details I will spare you.</p>

<p>In any case, again I am sorry that I acted so rashly and started a bit of a tempest.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it is completely <em>not accetable as an answer</em>, simply because answer should give a solution. The rules for me are simple: Either I know the solution and then I post an answer, or I do not and then I should post my ideas as comments.</p>

<p>I would like to know what is / should be the good practice and if such answeres should be flagged for moderator attention.</p>

<p><em>(Background: I come from <a href=""https://tex.stackexchange.com/"">TeX.SE</a> and this is this a key rule there, and many answers get transferred to comments.)</em></p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I'm of the opinion that ""answers"" which provide only hints and intentionally avoid providing a direct answer should be treated as bad answers: downvoted, deleted, or converted to comments, as appropriate.</p>

<p>For users who insist on trying to provide hints to certain questions, I think complete answers in spoiler tags are acceptable.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>There isn't a clear line between a hint and an answer. For an expert a short statement stating the essential points would be sufficient as an answer and probably preferable also; for a novice the situation might be different.</p>

<p>If an answer is partial or just gives hints about the answer it still counts as an answer as long as it provides correct non-trivial information about what is being asked. It doesn't restrict other users ability to post full answers if they want to. If you don't like an answer don't up-vote it.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think that hints should be provided as answers. This isn't a site for doing people's homework, but helping them understand the ideas that will help them to do their own homework. Sometimes a hint is sufficient to achieve that goal. </p>

<p>One difference with TeX.SE (and correct me if I'm wrong) is that students are less likely to be going to TeX.SE to get answers for their homework and assignments. TeX.SE is more about getting the solutions to various problems, not necessarily about understanding some fundamentals. I believe that hints are key to helping students get over hurdles in their to understanding.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>About both. The purpose of a tag wiki excerpt is to guide people when they are deciding how to tag a question.</p>

<p>If the meaning of the tag is not generally known to anyone who would ask a question in that field, then the excerpt should explain it. For example, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/algorithms"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;algorithms&#39;"" rel=""tag"">algorithms</a> does not need a definition, but <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reductions"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reductions&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reductions</a> does. The excerpt doesn't need to have a correct and complete definition, it's enough to give the context.</p>

<p>The excerpt should concentrate on the usage of the tag on the site. If the word has other meanings that are not applicable to computer science, this is irrelevant (unless there is a popular misconception to dispel). If the way the tag name is interpreted on the site is not the way every reasonable computer scientist would understand it, then the excerpt should contain enough guidance to understand what the tag means here.</p>

<p>If there is a risk of confusion between several tags, or if there are many off-topic questions in the tag, then the excerpt may need to mention what questions should not have this tag, and possibly where to ask the question instead. This is fairly rare; related tags and sites are usually only mentioned in the tag wiki.</p>

<p>The official guidance on tag wiki excerpts is in the blog post <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/improved-tagging/"">Improved tagging</a>. For tag wikis in general, read <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/"">Redesigned tags page</a>.</p>

5,"<p>The moderators have been cleaning up and deleting closed questions. While in principle, this is good to keep the site clean, it has the huge negative effect of reducing our hard earned reputation. I answered the questions in good faith, but now I've lost more than 100 reputation points. I know that in CSTheory.SE, we only ever deleted spam, but almost never deleted questions. </p>

<p>In my opinion, closed questions (with up-voted answers) should not be deleted. It is not a bad idea to keep closed questions around, for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Closed questions quickly fall down the list and do not appear on the front page. </li>
<li>Closed questions provide a record of what questions are not on topic. </li>
<li>Closed questions can also be referred to if the same question appears again, thereby avoiding any debate or disgruntled feelings.</li>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>Let me quote a <a href=""https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/149/should-we-be-deleting-bad-questions/150#150"">very good explanation</a> of the <strong>rationale</strong> for deleting closed questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a question is valuable enough that it should stay on the site, it should be reopened or fixed into a state that permits reopening. Otherwise, excepting duplicates, it should eventually be deleted if no one expects that it'll be reopened.</p>
<p>If you take the &quot;head on a pike&quot; approach of showing &quot;This is what happens to people who ask what we don't want&quot;, it looks rather unsightly. If the problem is because the question is incomplete or broad or something else that can be fixed, keeping it around when someone does not fix it just means you keep what is essentially a mockery of the asker. If the problem is because the question falls outside the scope of the site, then keeping it around invites the problem of users discovering the site because they found that subject matter on the site. The majority of traffic to sites come from searches, so keeping things you do not want people to ask out of sight through deletion helps prevent more people from coming and asking the same thing. &quot;Head on a pike&quot; only really serves as a gruesome reactionary measure than a prevention of the incident.</p>
<p>As such, I recommend that if a question can't be fixed or does not wish to be fixed, that it probably serves the community better if it is deleted. You can give equal guidance to those who run afoul of the rules by pointing at established guidelines - things you write out on the above pages as well as in Meta discussions.</p>

<p>Why would you <em>delete</em> a question? Isn’t closing it enough?<br />

<ul>
<li>If users see a lot of closed questions, they’ll note that we don’t enforce the guidelines, so why should they?

If this goes on for long enough, we’re no longer a community of programmers who ask and answer programming questions, we’re a community of random people discussing.. whatever. That’s toxic.</li>

<p>The point of deleting questions is <em>in fine</em> to make the Internet a better place. Closed questions (throughout this post, this does not include duplicates) are questions that have been considered unwelcome here. Off-topic questions are questions we do not have the expertise to answer; our answers have not been reviewed by competent people, so their validity is put into question. Non-constructive or “not real” questions are questions that cannot reasonably be answered; answers to such questions are usually partial and often miselading. Too localized questions do not add value due to highly limited interest.</p>

<p>Responding to your arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reputation points are not a consideration when taking moderation actions (whether acting as a user with reputation-granted privileges, or as a diamond moderator). The purpose of moderation is to clean up the site.</li>
<li>Closed questions are still found in searches. They have exactly the same visibility as open questions.</li>
<li>I have never seen it useful to have a record of rejected questions.</li>
<li>When a borderline question is asked, it is best if there is no closed, non-deleted similar question already on the site. This lets the new question be evaluated on its own merits, rather than being summarily lumped with the old question and pressured into sharing its fate.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not see why Computer Science should have a different policy from other sites.</p>
<p>Closed questions are not deleted while there is still debate as to whether they should be reopened. After two weeks, I did not see any hint of a debate as to whether <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/1306/why-does-knuth-persist-with-mix-mmix"">Why does Knuth persist with MIX/MMIX?</a> might be reopened.

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/1031/how-to-prove-that-a-language-is-not-regular"">How to prove that a language is not regular?</a> is asking for a formal treatment of regular languages, and the answer, while helpful to many, isn't helpful if you don't understand much of the formal semantics involved in TCS if you are just starting out. My question, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/1830/why-is-l-0n-1n-n-geq-1-not-regular-language"">Why is $L= \{ 0^n 1^n | n \geq 1 \}$ not regular language?</a> is asking for a very informal, and easy to understand explanation, hopefully without the formalism needed to understand the former question, that why a specific language which was presented in a automata lecture, not a regular language. (So far Artem's answer in the comment section made the most sense) IMO, the two questions is asking for a completely different kind of answer, even though they have huge overlap, so I would argue they are not <strong>exact</strong> duplicates. They look duplicate to an expert, but for novices, the question ""How to prove that a language is not regular"" wouldn't even come cross your mind when you have question about why language X is not regular.</p>

5,"<p>Usually those ""why..."" questions end up accepting a proof, so I closed as duplicate (following existing flags). </p>

<p>In general, I often do not see the point in those questions; the statement holds because it holds. They can be made interesting by providing context: ""Why is A regular but B is not? They look so similar!"" because then an answerer can exhibit the difference. </p>

<p>As a ""flat"" question I do not see good answers that are not ""trivial"" or need some working knowledge of the involved formalisms (in this case, a characterisation of what NFA can do).

<p>Speaking of <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/1031/how-to-prove-that-a-language-is-not-regular"">that reference question</a>, I have a concern with the answers. They're all fairly advanced, tough reading for an undergraduate student.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/1033"">Romuald's answer</a> (accepted) has the right material, but it is extremely terse. It's more of a table of contents than a full answer at the level I'd expect.</li>
<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/1032"">Dave Clarke's answer</a> is good and easy to follow, but it only covers one example of the pumping lemma, and it's a bit close to the metal without showing the intuitions that the learning student would need to acquire.</li>
<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/1036"">Louis's answer</a> is very good at showing the intuition behind the pumping lemma, but the gap between that and writing a proof is rather wide. (Hmmm, combined with Dave's answer, it's not too bad.)</li>
<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/1051"">Ran G.'s answer</a> is the most didactic presentation of the pumping lemma on this page, but doesn't go beyond this, and may be harder to follow than Dave's for a beginner.</li>
<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/1091"">Raphael's answer</a> is at another level altogether.</li>
</ul>

<p>“How do I prove that this language is not regular” is very often asked by an undergraduate student who is only now studying the topic for the first time. We have good answers, but somewhat missing their target audience. Should we do better? Can we?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>This was suppose to be a comment on @Raphael's answer, with which I strongly disagree:</p>

<p>In my day-to-day activities I do more than churn symbols and do formal calculations and proofs. Above all else, my success or failure depends not on my ability to formally manipulate Greek letters, but on the intuitions I have and how useful they are. Thus, a question asking for intuitions is perfectly valid, and if someone answers a request for intuition with a formal proof <em>without</em> and intuitive argument to back it, then their answer should be down-voted as <em>not answering the question</em>. </p>

<p>When you are experienced with TCS it is easy to jump back and forth between Greek and intuition. When you are learning, this becomes a very important (and often difficult) skill to acquire! We should encourage students by reminding them that TCS is not an impenetrable fortress of formal symbols, but that the formal symbols are just our tools to express and test our intuitions.</p>

<p>As for the case of Ken Li's question, it was very poorly formulated. As it was formulated, it did not ask for intuition and thus an application of the pumping lemma would have been a valid answer; hence I think it was justified to close the question. If the question read something like:</p>

<p>""I know that ${ 0^n 1^n | n \geq 1 }$ is not regular, and I can carry out the standard pumping-lemma proof to prove it. However, I don't grok this: what is the intuition behind <strong>why</strong> we would expect the language to be not regular?""</p>

<p>Then it would not be an exact duplicate, and a simple pumping lemma proof would be an incorrect answer.</p>

The outcome of the discussion was this question is not useful as is, and should be improved or removed. There were follow-up discussions in chat too. The author of the question agreed that the question was not useful and could not be salvaged.</p>

<p>If you approach this issue from first principles instead of policies, this particular question asked for a general explanation on the subject of a Wikipedia article. Said Wikipedia article is markedly better than the answer produced by our community. Thus having the thread on the site made the site and the Internet worse, by distracting from the existing, better material. Even if a better answerer should come later, that person would serve the Internet better by improving the Wikipedia article.</p>

As I wrote there, it is the general policy on Stack Exchange to delete closed questions (duplicates excepted) if it becomes clear that they will not be reopened.</p>

<p>Your proposed policy would lead to keeping bad content around. It would be harmful for the site.</p>

5,"<p>Here's what's bound to be an unpopular answer.</p>

<p>Questions asking for different kinds of answers to the same underlying question should be closed as duplicates, and with extreme prejudice. They may then either be left as sign posts or deleted, potentially merging good answers and/or elements of the question into the main thread. Help comes in many forms, some of which may not be expected by the person asking the question.</p>

<p>More generally, requests to artificially restrict the form (rather than focus on specified content) should not be honored. For instance, requests for hints to questions with full answers need not be honored (hints may be given, but full answers should not be penalized); requests for intuition rather than formalism may likewise be ignored.</p>

<p>When people ask questions and provide answers here, that becomes the property of the community. Is it right to give somebody your hat and then demand that they wear it backwards? I suppose one could make a convincing analogy to copyleft licenses, but I digress. IMHO, there is no place for these kinds of restrictions on the form of answers. Real or implied restrictions should be removed from all questions (though this does not address the question of how to draw a meaningful distinction between form and content).</p>

5,"<p>There has been <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/86043/introduce-a-general-reference-close-reason"">some discussion of introducing a new close reason, “general reference”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question is too basic; it can be definitively and permanently answered by a single link to a standard internet reference source designed specifically to find that type of information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This close reason is currently available on two Stack Exchange sites: <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/"">English Language and Usage</a> and <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/"">Science Fiction and Fantasy</a>. The return from experience is mixed: it's useful sometimes, but has a huge potential for abuse.</p>

<p>I've <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/86043/introduce-a-general-reference-close-reason/101179#101179"">written my opinion on general reference as a close reason on the main meta</a>; here's a quick summary. I disagree with Google as a benchmark for declaring a question unworthy of the site, because it is harder to find relevant search results when you have no idea of what the answer is, and most importantly it is very hard to evaluate whether the search results are reliable and give a complete picture.</p>

<p>A far better metric (and this is the way we apply closing as general reference on SF&amp;F, and the way we use “too localized” in the absence of “general reference” on <a href=""http://french.stackexchange.com"">French Language and Usage</a>) is to look up the <strong>obvious</strong> keyword in the <strong>obvious</strong> reference. Wikipedia is the obvious reference in many cases (on French SE, “any dictionary would give the answer” is the usual metric).</p>

<p>So let me look up <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">median</a>. It's all about statistics, the article doesn't have the word “array” anywhere. Ok, maybe it's in another article listed on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_%28disambiguation%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">disambiguation page</a>. Hmmm, no.</p>

<p>Now let me try your <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=median+of+unsorted+array+in+O%28n%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google search</a>. The top results for me are:</p>

<p>The answer is <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/34/are-questions-on-introductory-undergraduate-cs-theory-appropriate-here"">yes</a>, but it feels hard to ask an easy question: we expect that all questions should have been the object of thorough research before being answered.</p>

<p>The case of homework is a little different: this may be a good idea to wait before giving a complete answer but I have the impression that having a complete answer is better in the long run.

<p>Even taking the original wording of the question (“Is there any way to estimate how much data is added to the Internet each second?

5,"<p>Here is <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/1263/41"">another example</a> where useful information is deleted by Gilles. (I was going to refer a user on cstheory to the answer posted <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/1264/41"">here</a> but I can't since it is deleted, and it took me considerable time to find even the deleted post.) Moreover since it is deleted by a moderator other users cannot vote to undelete it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let me emphasis that this is not about deleting closed question per se, it is about <em>unilateral</em> deletion by moderators by default without consulting the community.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/329/should-closed-questions-be-deleted/332#332"">The arguments</a> for justifying <em>unilateral</em> deletion provided so far are very unconvincing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If users see a lot of closed questions, they’ll note that we don’t enforce the guidelines, so why should they? Without any final resolution, asking questions that get closed becomes something we are implicitly encouraging — a broken windows problem. If this goes on for long enough, we’re no longer a community of programmers who ask and answer programming questions, we’re a community of random people discussing.. whatever. That’s toxic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very illogical argument if by guidelines we mean ""deletion"": to put a bad guideline and then say that we have to enforce it because otherwise the guidelines are not enforced is absurd. If the guideline means not permitting off-topic questions, closure is a sufficient demonstration of that, it is also information for the user who might want to ask similar question, not only it shows that similar questions are not welcome, it tells them why they are not welcome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If enough of these closed questions are allowed to hang around, they become clutter that reduces the overall signal to noise ratio — which further reduces confidence in the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The deletion only occurs after the question have left the front page, so this is not a real issue there. When searching, a user can search for non-closed questions easily using ""closed:0"" in their search so this is not a problem there either. It is like going over Internet and removing sites that we don't like so the Internet is more ""clean"".</p>

<p>Another argument which is expressed implicitly is that this is the general rule of SE sites. This is not the case as the Math.SE demonstrates. The guidelines on MSO are generally based on the situation on the trilogy (SO/SU/SF) and may not need to be required or even beneficial to other sites like CS.SE. My perception based, on the previous meta discussions, is that we agree that CS.SE is closer in nature to sites like Math.SE than to SO or cstheory, so if we are going to adopt policies from other sites, then it is more natural to check the policies on Math.SE than on SO.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here are some arguments for not deleting upvoted posts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>These posts can and do contain useful information (as illustrated by votes), so they make the Internet a better place,</p></li>
<li><p>Authors have put effort to write them, it is disrespectful to them to unilaterally delete their posts, (Should I spend my time writing  answers if a moderator is going to unilaterally delete it although there isn't anything wrong with my answer?)</p></li>
<li><p>No one (other than the moderator) has indicated a problem with them staying on the site, if the post is really harmful to stay on the site then it shouldn't be difficult to convince others users about the deletion.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>This automatic deletion of closed posts seems more to be about the personal taste of the moderators and than a required action to help the site. </p>

<p>Since this has resulted in confusion, let me repeat once again that this policy is only about <em>unilateral deletion of upvoted posts by default</em>. The existence of similar, larger, and very successful SE sites like Math.SE where closed questions are not generally deleted puts serious doubt about a real need for this automatic deletion of all closed questions. If a post or a type of post is harmful in general then it shouldn't be difficult to find 5 users to delete the question. </p>

<p>Unilateral deletion of upvoted posts by binding moderator powers should be limited to extreme cases where the community cannot act in time to deal with the issue and should not be a general rule, not highly upvoted posts without any user other than moderators indicating a need for deletion.</p>

5,"<p>I agree with Gilles that most closed questions should be deleted after some time: they have little value. However, there may be exceptions. That is in my opinion not enough to change the default behaviour, but it should be considered. Therefore, I have a proposal to make.</p>

<p>It takes five users (with high reputation) to vote a question to deletion. Based on our current average level of involvement, I think it is unlikely that this ever happens <em>even for questions that should clearly be deleted.</em> We have three moderators right now, that is 60% of the necessary votes could be made by moderators without community involvement. As, arguably, the moderators are among the most trusted community members, a decision that has a majority among moderators should be acceptable for the community (individual dissenters notwithstanding). So, my proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every four weeks, we post a meta question to decide which closed questions of five to eight weeks ago should be deleted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question would have a fixed and relatively small expiration date. This does the following for us.</p>

<ol>
<li>It establishes a predictable time frame in which questions can be salvaged (at least four weeks).</li>
<li>It gives ample opportunity to do so.</li>
<li>Decision is not made by a single person; everybody can participate.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the case that it is decided a question should not be deleted, those who want to keep it are responsible for improving the question. If that does not happen until the next meeting, the question is deleted without further discussion.</p>

5,"<p>In my answer to the question <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2079/determine-missing-number-in-data-stream/2087#comment5500_2087"">Determine missing number in data stream</a> I have a comment which indicates C++ is not a valid form of pseudo-code. Lacking a formal definition of what <em>pseudo-code</em> actually is I don't see how specified languages can be excluded.</p>

<p>C++ is defined in terms of a series of objects and operations working on an abstract machine. The meaning of the code is unambiguous. Indeed, the syntax of C, on which C++ is based, is often used as the basis of pseudo-code, so it can't be entirely incorrect to use such syntax.</p>

<p>The argument was made that somebody who doesn't know C++ wouldn't understand the answer. Is this not true of absolutely any language, even pseudo code? If I choose to answer in nothing but a series of set operations, one would have to be well versed in those to understand. If I chose to answer with any formal language you'd also have to be versed in that to understand. That is, regardless of how I answer the question, somebody would have to understand that language to be able to understand the answer.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>In the particular case to which you linked, honestly speaking, I do not see the point of posting the C++ code.  HdM’s comment is clear enough and it is much easier to understand than the C++ code.</p>

<p>As a means to explain an algorithm in general, pseudocode is sometimes more useful than (say) C++ because we can avoid specifying unimportant details.  For example, if the order of processing vertices in a graph does not matter, we can write</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each vertex <i>v</i>, …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>instead of</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For vertices <i>v</i>=1,…,<i>n</i>, …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the former is better because it clarifies that order does not matter.  Specifying unimportant details obscures the essence of the algorithm, and doing so just to use an existing programming language is probably not a good thing if our purpose is to communicate an algorithm.</p>

<p>(This example was taken from <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8893/good-practices-for-writing-algorithms/8912#8912"">JɛﬀE’s answer</a> to a question on cstheory.stackexchange.com.)</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The main argument, imho, is clutter: a good answer exposes the relevant knowledge in a clear way. You have posted 50 lines of code; the actual algorithm consists of <em>five</em> lines. That's 90% irrelevant stuff there. You even have to scroll to find the actual algorithm. All in all, that is clearly a bad way to present an <em>algorithm</em> (note: not ""program"").</p>

<p>Note that the essential five lines would be completely fine as (part of an) answer even though they are C++; there is nothing special going on there (the pointer arithmetic can be ignored safely). Maybe a note of what <code>^</code> does is in order, but that is mostly clear from context, even if the reader has never used a C-ish language.</p>

<p>Also, your original answer did not contain <em>any</em> justification for why the algorithm should work. ""I tested it for some inputs"" may be a valid answer on SO but not here (in most cases). A formal proof is not needed or warranted in many cases, but there should be some conclusive correctness argument. You have since edited that in, so that makes your answer a lot better.</p>

<p>Of course you can post whatever you like. The commenters try to help you to improve your answer; if you decide to ignore them, that is your choice.</p>

<p>By the way, I approve of algorithms that have been implemented and tested. After all, most formal proofs are high-level (see Tsuyoshi's answer) so some develish details may be wrong; bugs like this can be found in almost every textbook. Many a runtime analysis has failed because of some innocent-looking line of pseudo code. However, an answer is usually not the place to do that. Maybe post your implementation and test code on pastebin or Github and link there; <em>that</em> would certainly add value to an otherwise good answer.</p>

5,"<p>An answer to an algorithms' question should be understandable without knowledge about a particular programming language. If your code is clear enough that a person who doesn't know anything about that language can understand it then it is fine, otherwise it can be considered as <em>not-answering-the-question</em>.</p>

<p>Moreover an answer to a algorithms' question should not just give some code (even in pseudo-code), it should explain why the algorithm works (if it is not clear). Just posting the code of a program even when it seems to work is not helpful, I think authors here are asking for algorithms to understand them, not merely program code that seems to work on some inputs without any explanation on why it is solving the problem. That might be a suitable answer on a programming Q&amp;A, it is probably not a good answer on a CS Q&amp;A.</p>

5,"<p>I don't care what the authors say, I will not refrain answering a question because someone somewhere requested people not to answer this question.</p>

<p>The <em>text</em> of the question belongs to the author of the book, and they may request that the text not be posted; in fact, that is automatically the case due to copyright law. The semantic content of the question does not belong to anyone, and anyone may ask the question, whether they first read it in that book or they made it up on their own. The authors of the book do not have a monopoly on the question.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the source of a question is required by academic traditions. Refusing to answer questions is very much against academic traditions.</p>

<p>Even if you're favorable to the authors' request (which I'm not), consider this from a practical angle: let's say someone wants to ask a question that is an exercise in this book, and they're aware of the policy. They can easily work around the policy by pretending to have come up with the question on their own. It's unenforceable.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As mentioned by Kaveh in comments, in <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/"">this</a> thread, subjective questions are allowed to be asked in some SE sites, but subjective questions which doesn't have exactly one accepted answer still is not suitable, actually best choice was making this questions as community wiki, but currently we don't have community wiki. So in my opinion because this question doesn't have a unique answer, and we can't mark any of answers as accepted once, seems it's not suitable for site. But still seems it's better to ask a feature to support such a good questions in site. But what should be feature I don't have any idea, except reusing community wiki.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>As blufox said, the specific question does not ask for a solution.  But I think that you raised a good point apart from the specific question: should we follow a request by an author not to post solutions to exercises in a book on the web?</p>

<p>Well, I do not have a solid opinion on the matter in general.  Given that there are different reasonable opinions, I do not think that it should be an enforced policy.  However, in the case of Arora and Barak, I think I would follow personally.  I value this textbook highly, and I find it reasonable for me to follow the authors’ small request in return to the efforts which they put into writing it.  Just my two cents.</p>

<p>Of course, as Gilles pointed out, it is not always possible to realize that the question is from Arora and Barak, especially if an asker intentionally hides or misrepresents the source.  But that does not change the fact that I intend to follow the authors’ request.</p>

<p>The goal of these tags to help people filter/search questions by diving them into reasonable subject categories. The idea is similar to categorizing used on other places like libraries, arXiv, AMS MSC, ACM CCS, etc.</p>

<hr>

<p>To keep the system useful the number of area tags needs to be kept small and every question should preferable be tagged by at least one of them.</p>

5,"<p>I would say that if anyone notices such a case (i.e a question which is an exercise from a book and the authors have specifically written that they're unhappy with solutions being posted online), then they should put this in a comment or edit the question to this effect. Then users who might want to answer can make an informed decision whether to go against the authors' policy or to comply.</p>

<p>But clarification questions like the one you linked should definitely be okay. Arora-Barak is a wonderful book, but it does have some typos and may not be perfectly clear in some places, especially to a novice in the field. That is of course true for almost any technical book, especially introductory textbooks that contain a lot of new material and are in their first edition.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Raphael has posted comments on several questions of <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/1594/user1594"">this user</a> giving references for the questions. This in combination with the following quote from Gilles' <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/396/41"">answer</a> suggests that we may want to have some policy regarding OP acknowledging the source of question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Acknowledging the source of a question is required by academic traditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think? Do we need a policy regarding acknowledgement? If yes, should we require it or should we only encourage it? (and how?)</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>When I wrote that acknowledging the source of a question is required by academic traditions, I meant just that: there is a standard of behavior which is followed by many participants of this site in their professional life, and which requires attribution of ideas. I did not intend to mean that this standard should be followed by this site's community.</p>

<p>I like the policy of crediting sources for ideas, and I intend to follow it (like I've followed it in my online participation outside this site). However, I'm reluctant to make this an official policy. Not that I don't encourage others to do the same — I do — but I don't think it should be required to credit every idea. Certainly most of the things that I write on Stack Exchange are not original ideas of mine, and only a tiny minority of my posts give credit for an idea. I only give credit when an idea is still associated in my mind with a particular source; after a while, it becomes fully internalized, and I take it for my own. I would dig deeper if I was writing an academic paper; in a more informal setting, I don't want more friction.</p>

<p>Although there is no official policy, there is a de facto policy of refusing <em>plagiarism</em> on Stack Exchange (see <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/122056/should-i-flag-plagiarism-for-moderator-attention"">Should I flag plagiarism for moderator attention?</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/83955/plagiarism-should-be-addressed-specifically-in-the-faq"">Plagiarism should be addressed specifically in the FAQ</a>). Plagiarism means copying text without attribution. It does not apply to ideas.</p>

<p>In summary, I encourage to give credit where it's due, but I'm reluctant to make this a policy (all the more as it would be very difficult to enforce).</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think that acknowledging the source should be encouraged, not required, and only when the source of the question is important. For instance, standard or otherwise generic content doesn't need references (even though it may appear in a specific work). In other words, if there's a useful citation for something, we should encourage users to cite it... the same standard as in academia, just less stringent and much less actively enforced. My point: encourage citation, but not everything requires citation, nor can all (pieces of) writing be plagiarized.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>In general, material cited or conciously taken from others' work <em>has</em> to be attributed properly. It might not be always possible to catch people not doing it, but some cases are more clear than others (for instance if publishing-ready graphics are used without attribution, or screenshots of PDFs). We have to trust users to know best what parts they have to give attribution for, but I think it is fair and even our ""duty"" to ask when there is doubt, in order to keep the standard as high as possible.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> In the cited case, consider my comments a (soft) moderation measure.</p>

<p>In that particular case, I have made the following observations.</p>

<ul>
<li>A person has been creating a multitude of accounts, all with closed and downvoted question of the same style.</li>
<li>Those questions are extremely homework-dumpish.</li>
<li>The person does not seem to digest the answers or hints at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also managed to figure out where the questions came from, and they are indeed copied from exercise sheets of an undergraduate TCS course. Therefore, I reasoned that</p>

<ul>
<li>the person tries to cheat and</li>
<li>the person abuses our site.</li>
</ul>

<p>As our methods of dealing with this are limited (in particular I would not expect suspensions to be effective) and former attempts to convince the person to change their behaviour failed, I decided to expose the person's misbehaviour by linking to the exercise sheets and annotating them with their due date, demonstrating that the person is trying to get us to do their homework in an objective way. I hope that other members of the site see this information and draw their own conclusions -- I can't force anyone to <em>not</em> help this person cheat.</p>

<p>Note that the person told me of their university affiliation in an email to me (to my private address!) and the exercise sheets are available publicly, so I am neither abusing my position nor disclosing private information.</p>

<li>The question is apparently not homework.</li>
</ol>

<p>So here is how I propose to deal with type 1 and 2 questions. In essence, the philosophy is not to fret about what is homework and what is not, but to act on the askers' wishes and to ask answerers to maintain professional integrity.</p>

<ul>
<li>No homework tag. As Alex has <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/316/98"">explained well</a>, it does not serve a useful purpose.</li>
<li>Whether the question is homework is not discussed. Trust the user or act on your suspicion.</li>
<li>If you answer, always give a complete answer (if you can).</li>
<li>On questions of type 1, honor the asker's request and post only hints. In order to fulfill the previous item, put details into spoiler tags (<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2379/is-switching-quantifiers-allowed-in-this-instance/2380#2380"">example 1</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2263/probabilities-of-duplicate-mail-detection-by-comparing-notes-among-servers/2266#2266"">example 2</a>). If you want, add the full details a week or so later so the asker can not use your answer to cheat.</li>
<li>On questions of type 2, follow your moral compass. You can treat such questions as type 1, ask the asker to improve/clarify their question, ignore them, downvote or even vote to close if the question is bad (e.g. no own effort, a copied assignment, ...). </li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that if we establish a climate of ""We solve your homework, no questions asked"" the site may gain a bad reputation among experts.</p>

<p>On the more difficile issue of how to enforce the policy -- that is, how moderators and high reps can make sure that other users adhere to above ""rules"" -- I suggest the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove all occurrences of <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homework"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;homework&#39;"" rel=""tag"">homework</a> (they <em>will</em> keep popping up).</li>
<li>If unclear, ask the asker whether they want hints or full answers.</li>
<li>Inform the inevitable ""Is this homework?"" commenters by linking to the policy.</li>
<li>On type 1 questions, ask answerers to act on the policy, edit posts accordingly if possible and vote down otherwise. That is, show a hard front here.</li>
<li>On type 2 questions, (at most) inform answerers of your suspicion and ask them to consider they might enable cheating. No further measures.</li>
</ul>
",CSmeta
5,"<p><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/461/69"">Raphael's answer</a>, with the following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>On questions of type 1, honoring the asker's request is acceptable, but not required, and should not be enforced. Clearly, full answers need not be given, but they should not be penalized.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think we should to worry about ""gaining a bad reputation among experts."" We can't be responsible for how people choose to use this site, and we would only be hurting the site if we tried. What people do with the answers we give is not our business.</p>

<p>There's no responsibility to ask users whether they want full answers or hints; in the absence of a request for hints, answerers can assume ful answers are desired, and even if hints are requested, full answers can be provided, without penalty. There's no meaningful objective distinction between ""hint"" and ""answer"" and we can save ourselves a lot of headaches and futile work by acknowledging this up-front.</p>

<p>No ""hard front"" for type-1 questions. Individual users should act on their beliefs regarding how questions/answers should be treated.</p>

<p>No need to bring up ""suspicions"" for type-2 questions; indeed, such comments should be treated however ""this is homework"" comments are treated.</p>

<p>Redux: Just to be clear, my ideal scenario would be that homework questions receive no special treatment, even if special treatment is requested. This makes completely moot all other questions about the homework policy: there is no such thing as a homework policy, since there's no such thing as a homework question. </p>

<p>Responding to the questions raised by Gilles:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Do homework questions get different treatment?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Does homework only cover questions given as exercise in a class? What about self-study?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Any question which could reasonably be construed as likely being a homework question can be treated as such.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>How do we decide whether a question is homework?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Non-moderators act according to their own judgement. Moderators get at least one other moderator to agree before taking action.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If there is a dispute as to whether a question is homework, who gets to decide?</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>Moderators are the final authority on whether a question is to be treated as homework.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Are homework questions marked as such? (Note that the idea of having a tag is unpopular.)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Does the policy risk preventing good questions from being asked or answered?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>As homework questions are not treated any differently or marked according to the above policy, it has no impact on questions asked or answered.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If someone asks a question which was obviously given as a homework exercise, and someone else asks substantially the same question but it is obvious that the asker is not a student who gets homework assigned, are the two questions treated differently?</p>

<p>No. </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<h3>Rationale</h3>

<ol>
<li>Do not prevent legitimate questions.</li>
<li>Avoid bickering about what constitutes homework.</li>
<li>Have grounds for closing obvious dumps of homework assignments that no one cares enough about to answer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Goal 1 implies a policy that is not overly restrictive: the asker is given the benefit of doubt. Goal 2 implies that the consequences of being considered homework must not be so important that people will fight over it. Goal 2 also implies that there must be some form of homework policy, otherwise we'll keep fighting over it forever. Goal 3 implies that the policy is not just “homework questions are allowed, period”.</p>

<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>There is no homework policy. But there are guidelines for homework questions.</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p>It is recommended for anyone asking a homework question that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>try to solve the problem on your own, and show in your question what you tried and where you are stuck;</li>
<li>look up the relevant concepts in Wikipedia, your lecture notes and your textbooks;</li>
<li>search the site for similar questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not do this, your question may be downvoted or closed, for the reasons explained below. Note that if your question is closed, you may still edit it; the question can be reopened if the edits make it acceptable.</p>

<h3>Commentary on the guidelines</h3>

<p>The existing rules of Stack Exchange already give us some grounds for closing the dregs of the homework questions. We might be more prone to applying the close reasons in cases where the asker is obviously dumping his homework on us. Questions that show obvious effort from the asker (“here's what I tried, and then I'm stuck”, “I tried the technique in this earlier answer but it didn't work because”) will remain open and unblemished, regardless of whether they are 
homework.</p>

<p>All questions on Stack Exchange must observe some quality guidelines that are described in the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/faq"">FAQ</a>, particularly in the section “<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/faq#close"">Why are some questions closed?</a>”, as well as in the page “<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask"">How to Ask</a>” which is linked from the FAQ. Here is a summary of the point that tend to apply to homework questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>A question that is just a dump of a homework assignment may be considered <em>too broad</em> and hence <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/faq#close"">closed</a> as <em>not a real question</em>.</li>
<li>A question that is similar to another question on the site, but with different data, may be closed as a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/faq#close"">duplicate</a>. For example, a question asking for a proof of why a language is not regular may be closed as a duplicate of a question asking for a proof why some other language is not regular, if the same kind of techniques work in both cases.</li>
<li>A question that is trivially answered by looking up a commonly-available reference such as Wikipedia may be closed as <em>too localized</em>, because it will not help any future visitors.</li>
<li>Questions on Stack Exchange that do not demonstrate any research effort may be downvoted (this is independent from closing). While a question may remain downvoted but open, heavily downvoted questions are removed from the front page and therefore are less likely to be answered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Corollaries</h3>

<p>The <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homework"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;homework&#39;"" rel=""tag"">homework</a> tag is meaningless and must not be used.</p>

<p>It is not acceptable to engage into disputes about the homework nature of a question. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not acceptable to nag askers into admitting that something is homework (“What did you try?” is fine; “Is this homework?” is noise).</li>
<li>It is not acceptable to reproach answerers for providing a complete answer to an obvious homework question. (Everyone is of course free to refrain from answering any given question.)</li>

One could write in the comments that the could cross-post them here. I know that often cross-posting is a vary bad idea, but in this case it might work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, that someone asking a question here is honest enough to tag it as homework, doesn't seem to me as a bad thing per se.

That's the way to deal with trolls, bullies and idiots in the Internet since, you know, <em>forever</em>. </p>

<p>My opinion is that much of the drama one can see on SO and elsewhere regarding homework questions has as much to do with cheeky students as it has to do with profs who are kittens in real life, but blood-thirsty tigers in the Internet.</p>

<p>The concerns regarding search - or filtering - of questions about particular topics seem to me meaningless (maybe I'm missing something, though).

<p>Homework questions are not treated differently.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>This way homework questions do not get any special treatment, they are
subject to the usual quality control rules. We do not need to argue
over whether a question is homework or not, and we can get rid of the
meaningless <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homework"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;homework&#39;"" rel=""tag"">homework</a> tag. We may have guidelines advising how to

(merged due to similarity)</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>We do not try to decide which questions are homework, and we don't use
a special tag. Users that want to receive hints rather than full
answers should say so, and answerers should honor such requests (by
not posting details or hiding them in spoiler tags). Other than that,
the usual quality control applies.</p>

<h2>Guideline</h2>

<p>All users should be aware that askers might use cs.SE to cheat and are
asked to act responsibly (e.g. by not answering, answering after a
delay or providing only hints) if they suspect a question is a mere
restatement of a homework exercise without own effort.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>We have no way of identifying homework questions reliably and in
general (with notable exceptions). Therefore, we have to take what
users post at face value. However, from a teaching point-of-view, it
is often more helpful to a student to be <em>led to</em> an answer instead of
<em>told</em> the answer. That is why we should work with helpful hints
rather than detailed answers where appropriate.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homework"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;homework&#39;"" rel=""tag"">homework</a> has no use given such a policy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we want to prevent students from exploiting cs.SE
to do their homework (i.e. cheat the system and themselves), as that
would not help them <em>and</em> might gain the site a bad reputation among
teachers. Most homework-dump-style questions should be dealt with by
usual quality-control, but that response might come with a delay or,
in special cases, never. In these cases, it is up to the users to
decide how to act.</p>

adapted to computer science and CS.SE.)</em></p>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<h3>Can I ask a homework question here?</h3>

<p>There are actually two factors involved here, one is on your end, and
one over here on this website.</p>

<p>As a general rule, we do not discourage any specific category of
questions, as long as it is mathematical. But please <strong>do</strong> make an
effort to search through the list of previously asked questions. In
our experience homework questions are usually not very imaginative,
and tend to fall in one of the <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1756/"">abstract categories of commonly asked
questions</a>. We
<strong>will</strong> close duplicate questions, especially if they are of homework
type.</p>

<p>On the other hand, whether your learning institution (middle school,
high school, college, etc.) and your teacher or professor allows you
to consult other people, or to post the exact question on the
internet, is something that is usually addressed by your institution's
honor code or rules and regulations, and any specific class policies.
You should ask your teacher whether asking a homework question here is
appropriate before posting your question.</p>

<h3>How do I ask a homework question on this website?</h3>

<p>Please use the <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homework"">homework
tag</a>. This
serves several purposes: the most important of which is to let the
answerer know to give an answer that more clearly explains the
underlying concepts. In other words, we believe in the ""teach a man to
fish"" philosophy.</p>

<p>Also, please put some work into formulating your question. Please <strong>do
not</strong> just copy and paste the exact question text from your homework
sheet. In particular, when you are asking for help, writing in
imperative mode (""Show that..."", ""Compute..."", or ""Prove or find a
counterexample: ..."") is at the very least impolite: you are, after
all, <a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trying to ask a question, not give an
assignment</a>. It
also turns many people off.</p>

<p>If you feel that it is somehow just so much more straightforward to
copy and paste, then it is generally good real world advice to both
<strong>quote the question</strong> (because you are copying after all) and <strong>give
a reference</strong> to the source (so that others can refer to the context
of the question).
You should also volunteer all relevant information (see next section).
It is a waste of everybody's time if someone has to ask for what you
should explicitly have given.</p>

<h3>What information should I include in a question about homework?</h3>

<p>The following are some things that may help your question get better
answers, or at least answer more tailored to your situation.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The context</em>. What kind of course it is, what textbook you use.
It wouldn't help you if someone gives an answer using some
sophisticated, high-powered machinery that you have never seen before.
(An example would be asking for help about a step that is used to
prove a big theorem in the textbook, and receiving an answer using
said big theorem.)</li>
<li><em>All the definitions</em>. If you are asking about a question that is
more advanced than basic college-level calculus, then you should
consider including the definitions. A lot of homework questions are
assigned to familiarize you with the definitions used in the course.
For many objects in mathematics there are several equivalent
definitions. What needs to be proven when starting from one set of
definitions may actually be a trivial consequence in a different set
of definitions and vice versa. It is important that you let us know
what framework in which you work so our answers can properly address
the question.</li>
<li><em>Show your work</em>. You should definitely include any partial work
you have done. This will help bolster your claim that you are not just
coming here asking other people to do your homework for you, and it
will help the answerers to give more clinical responses. Showing your
work will help us gauge where you are having problems: if it is a
technical thing near the end, a short to the point answer will
suffice; if it is some fundamental problem with understanding the
subject, we will then write a longer, more detailed response. It will
also prevent people from spending a lot of time going over ground that
you have already covered or understand well already.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why don't you provide a complete answer to my question?</h3>

<p>We've had another
<a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/415"">discussion</a> from
the point of view of the answerer, and you should see that for a more
complete discussion. To quote the accepted answer in that thread, we
feel that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Providing an answer that doesn't help
  a student learn is not in the
  student's own best interest, and if a
  solution complete enough to be copied
  verbatim and handed in is given
  immediately, it will encourage more
  people to use the site as a free
  homework service. In the spirit of
  creating a lasting resource of
  mathematical knowledge, you may come
  back after a suitable amount of time
  and edit your response to include a
  more complete answer. Or even better,
  the student can post his own correct
  answer!</p>

<p>This is not quite it. The asker may be trying to solve a problem in their domain using computer science (tools). In my opinion, tool support questions are feasible here if</p>

<ol>
<li>the question requires CS expertise (that is not only tool expertise!) and</li>
<li>the tool the asker uses is an artefact of (contemporary) computer science.</li>
</ol>

<p>(1) can (but does not have to) imply that a good answer to the question should carry over to other, similar tools. For example, a question asking how to do something in proof assisstant X can cause answers that can be applied to proof assisstant Y. We have had examples of such questions, iirc.</p>

<p>Regarding (2), proof assisstants and SAT solvers are, arguably, artefacts of computer science. Most other tools are not. Compilers can be seen as such; here it depends on which aspect the question touches. Questions about the principles underlying a certain optimisation in the gcc are ok, questions of the kind ""What does compiler flag -g do?"" not.</p>

5,"<p>I am puzzled if it is appropriate to ask for resources/referemces for good exercises for an introductory TCS course. I personally think that this is a very precise question, but I see the danger that the answers might depend very much on everyone's personal opinion, which might lead to an open-ended discussion. Also I noticed that related questions such as</p>

5,"<p>List questions are a problem for the platform because ranking answers does not make a lot of sense. We have not definitely decided yet how to treat them (see <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/20/what-about-list-questions"">here</a> and <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/145/98"">here</a>) -- different sites have different policies -- but the tendency seems to be that we don't want them (maybe because they don't know how to deal with them).</p>

<p>Therefore, I think you should not post the question as proposed (and certainly not on cstheory). If the <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/23685/educators?referrer=KIYoBIrhRH8gzQ7ReguWpg2"">Educators proposal</a> goes live, maybe it will be the place for such question.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em>, however, set up your own resource (a wiki?) for this purpose, which would be great and useful.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>As far as I understand it, the policy regarding list questions is an ongoing discussion (see <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/20/what-about-list-questions"">here</a> and <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/145/our-first-list-question"">here</a>). The idea is that we should built up a community first, and then discuss how to handle this issue. I agree with this, but I also think that there should be guidelines for the transition phase. Right now the policy seems inconsistent.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that we should handle list questions as liberal as possible for now. </p>

<p>I had a brief look at mathoverflow, math.SE and cstheory.SE (see for example <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/143/about-the-soft-question-and-big-list-tags"">here</a>). Here it seems okay to have list questions at some extend. Indeed, list questions receive usually a high number of upvotes.</p>

<p>I would like to propose the following:
<em>(I extended the following items, some of the comments might refer to the frist version of the question.)</em></p>

<ol>
<li>List questions are allowed, if they are cs-related, and the question is a real question. In particular, they should follow these <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/"">guidelines</a>.</li>
<li>All list questions are tagged. This might be a <strong>big-list</strong> or <strong>subjective</strong> tag.</li>
<li>All list questions should be community wikis. (Not so sure about this.)</li>
<li>If a list question turns into a open discussion or a long list of items it will be closed.</li>
<li>If the community has grown, we review our policy.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Discussions are welcome.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>We can take a step back and try to look at the question of ""list questions"" a little more broadly. What is the difference between a ""list question"" and a non-""list question""?</p>

<p>First off, it's not that there are multiple good/correct/up-voted answers, and it's not that older answers accumulate more up-votes. That's all true (at least potentially, in theory) of <em>any</em> non-trivial question. By itself, it is not enough to distinguish ""list questions"" from non-""list questions"".</p>

<p>Second, it's not that list questions are inherently (bad) subjective. Non-""list questions"" can be (bad) subjective, and so can ""list questions""; ""list questions"" can also be objective or (good) subjective.</p>

<p>I feel that that where ""list questions"" most reliably fail is in the interplay between these two factors. Either the question is too broad or hard to understand, or the answers are (bad) subjective - in the sense that the answerer doesn't bother to explain and motivate answers properly, since this is somehow not expected of answers to ""list questions"". The former problem is already handled by other means, and the latter can be handled by rules already governing the quality of answers, so long as we make sure to change (and enforce) expectations.</p>

<p>I propose that we allow ""list questions"" with no special treatment, but enforce the following rules as rigorously as we would on any non-""list question"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>The question must ask for a well-defined, sufficiently-scoped list of items.</li>
  <li>Each answer must provide objective or (good) subjective argument for the proposed list item(s)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Especially with regard to item 2: simply providing an item as the answer wouldn't cut it, and answers that are clearly (bad) subjective are either removed or converted to comments. With regard to 1, if the question isn't salvageable, it and all the answers are killed with extreme prejudice and without looking back.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The problem with “list questions” — questions like “What are some interesting results about this object?” and “What books are there about this subject?” — is that they do not call for answers, they call for items. The Stack Exchange platform is not well-suited for lists.</p>

<p>Lists don't tend to generate discussion. Usually, the outcome of a list question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>either only a few answers, which makes the answers as a whole woefully incomplete, so that even all the answers taken together do not make a good answer to the question;</li>
<li>or many answers, sorted in a way that doesn't cater to relevance, with no indication of why one would prefer this or that answer, with many duplicates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Voting on items tends to privilege whatever was posted first, and secondly the most popular items. It practically never highlights the best items (whatever <em>best</em> can mean in context) or the most relevant ones.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All list questions should be community wikis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Making the question community wiki doesn't change anything to the quality of the answers. On this topic, please read <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/"">the future of community wiki</a>.</p>

<p>List questions sometimes work on Math Overflow and CSTheory because there's a major entry barrier: only a select few like-minded people participate on the site. This significantly reduces the bad, poorly sourced content. The lists of items might not be complete or rated but at least most of the items tend to be relevant. Experience shows that this isn't the case on less selective sites.</p>

<p>Math.SE might be able to afford a few duds now and then, but CS.SE doesn't have the established user base and traffic volume to accommodate a bunch of low-quality questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My personal opinion is that we should handle list questions as liberal as possible for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ouch, no.
The proper response to expected train wrecks is not to watch them accummulate and cordon off the perimeter and send excuses to the families when they happen. Rather, we should prevent the train wrecks in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the community has grown, we discuss this question again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, on the contrary, quality can only go down. The time to eliminate bad questions is now, not after the site has failed because there were too few actual questions amid a sea of lists.</p>

<p>Questions on Stack Exchange must be <strong>answerable</strong>. That means that there is the expectation that <strong>one</strong> answer will be a sufficient resource on the question. If every answer has one item, that doesn't happen. For example: do not ask “what is the best book about X?” or “I want to read a book about X, what are the possibilities?”, because they call for items. On the other hand, a question like “What collection of books and articles would make a good background for a semester course about X?” can be a good question; different answers might give different reading lists, sometimes mentioning the same book but in a different set and with different rationales. Then each answer is useful on its own.</p>

<p>In a nutshell: <strong>don't ask for a book, ask for a curriculum</strong>.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The problem with list questions is less with the questions themselves, but with the answers they encourage. We have little effective means to prevent bad answers (between downvoting as mild measure and outright deletion as hammer, there is nothing). Therefore it is easier to close questions that promote (maybe only) bad answers than to try and make the community downvote bad answers. Note that we have been allowing <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reference-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reference-request</a> questions -- often inherently list questions! -- which are reasonably scoped.</p>

<p>So, the real question here is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What to do with questions that explicitly or implicitly ask for flat lists of items?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, why are lists of items a problem? Gilles has already outlined why they don't work well with the SE platform: usually all answers are of similar objetive value, ranking them makes no sense. As a collection of knowledge, wikis (for instance tag wikis) work better. Furthermore, such lists usually become -- once they converge towards completeness -- impossible to read, because there is no structure.</p>

<p>Is it possible to overcome these issues? Sure. <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1168/what-papers-should-everyone-read"">What papers should everyone read? on cstheory.SE</a> asks for semi-objective recommendations and many (of the top) answers give reasons for <em>why</em> you should read the respective paper. <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3253/what-books-should-everyone-read"">What books should everyone read? on cstheory.SE</a> works well because there is one aggregated answer per category, thus the list is structured¹.</p>

<p>Consider on the other hand <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/10387/beautiful-results-in-tcs"">Beautiful results in TCS on cstheory.SE</a>; this is a completely unstructured, purely subjective blobb of things. Look at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15496/hidden-features-of-java"">Hidden Features of Java</a> which is nice to skim through for entertainment, but a useless reference due to redundancy and lack of structure. <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/46716/what-should-every-programmer-know-about-web-development"">What should every programmer know about web development?</a> has escalated in rambling, subjective lists of lists, often without any justification.</p>

<p>What do all these questions have in common? They are <em>broad</em>, and often ask for subjective  statements². Which of them do work (as question on SE)? Those where a relatively small group of experts has come together and carefully shaped the list in a useful form.</p>

<p>Therefore, I think we can reasonably allow list questions, but we need a policy that governs aggregation and structuring of the answers. As mentioned in ¹, this was tried in the early days of cs.SE with little success due to lack of consensus and cooperation. I tried to <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/155/98"">formulate</a> a policy³ but it was downvoted (without comment).</p>

<p>So, bottom line: I have no qualms with list questions <em>as long as they are kept tidy</em>. In order to do so, we need a clear policy (maybe even mandate!) to do so. So, no list questions until we have a policy. I propose my <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/155/98"">sketch</a> form back then again, although it might need some polishing if we get down to it.</p>

<li>I tried something similar <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/454/list-of-intro-tcs-books-for-those-who-dont-know-much-about-tcs"">here</a> but the effort was rejected.</li>
<li>To an extent, that is true for <em>any</em> answer: even if I write a proof, the method and style I use is highly subjective. So there is no clear-cut criterion. ""How do I best write down an induction proof?"" is subjective, but narrow enough to produce good, <em>comparable</em> answers.</li>
<li>Since we have mods now, users do no longer need to delete their own answers; we can do that. In the long run, the community should maintain such questions on its own.</li>
</ol>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>This is a very important topic. Let me note that some queries already place cs.SE content reasonably high, for instance ""prove language not context-free"" (<a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/html/?q=prove+language+not+context-free"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">duckduckgo</a>, <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=prove%20language%20not%20context-free"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google</a>) and ""why is quicksort fast"" (<a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/html/?q=why+is+quicksort+fast"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">duckduckgo</a>). I assume the situation is similar (and improving) for other popular questions.</p>

<p>Another observation is that when we had a huge spike of visits <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/360/98"">due to a tweet</a> and/or <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/trlcx/how_not_to_solve_p_np/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reddit</a>, some of them stuck. Ever since that peek, our average number of visits has been higher (from around 300 to around 350). That suggests that we have something to offer and people come again once they know of us at all.</p>

<p>In general terms, we want</p>

<ul>
<li>people to come here with their questions and</li>
<li>people to find our answers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two items are strongly intertwined: better questions mean better answers mean more exposure mean more people with questions. In order to achieve these, we have to</p>

<ul>
<li>be known and respected among computer scientists (of all kinds) and people using computer science and</li>
<li>be searchable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, these issues are not independent.</p>

<p>In order to be known, we have be visible for our target group. Search queries may be able to do that to some extent in the future, but right now we rely on word of mouth. We have to literally spread the word when talking with colleagues and friends, posting content on the web and attending meetings. Some people will do that casually because they had a good experience, others will put in honest effort because they care about the site as a whole.</p>

<p>In order to be searchable, we have to be linked (by important sites), plain and simple. Other than waiting for satisfied users to link to us, what can we as core community do? I think we can mainly inject links to our good content in other communities, for instance other Stack Exchange site, Wikipedia, newsgroups, social networks, etc. Other than that, we have to work on the first item and rely on the powers of the crowd: if it is good, they will link it.</p>

<p>One issue I personally have with advertising is a lack of brand. We have no logo, no pitch phrase, no nothing. I am considering to initiate an effort to develop prototypical elements we can put on (website) banners, posters, powerpoint slides, shirts, stickers, you name it. I think I could motivate more than one professor to plug our site, but for that we need a memorable presentation. What do you think about that?</p>

<p>One issue I have no solution for is language. I would expect native speakers of other major languages (Spanish, French, Mandarin, even German) -- especially pupils and undergrads, maybe also practitoners -- to search <em>in their own language</em>. They won't find us this way. So we have to put extra effort into advertisement to non-English folks. Maybe blog articles in several languages pointing here can help?</p>

<p>Furthermore, note that most of our questions fall into TCS. This is probably natural as students tend to struggle most in TCS, and we have more experts in TCS than in other subfields. However, relatively few people are deeply interested in theory so it stands to reason that we can expand our audience considerably by widening our practiced scope (in defined scope <em>does</em> include all CS).</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I have been wondering: does the quality of an answer and its upvotes always correlate? It should, but it obviously does not. Obviously, because not everybody gets all aspects of every answer. Differences in style and taste influence voting behaviour, too. But I have the impression that there is more at work.</p>

<p>I have observed that those answers I put the most thought and effort into are often those with the least reaction. I am sure the effect is not restricted to my own answers, but those I have a good overview of, so please bear with me.</p>

<p>Let's look at some recent examples.</p>

<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2868/how-to-call-something-that-can-be-either-a-terminal-or-a-nonterminal/2870#2870"">How to call something that can be either a terminal or a nonterminal?</a> -- trivial answer. 5 upvotes.</li>

</ul>

<p>On the other hand, we have:</p>

If I may say so myself, it's quite elegant a reduction and exactly what the OP wanted. 1 upvote.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, I am in no position to judge the quality of my own answers, but I can't shed the feeling that putting in significant effort -- that is answering questions I don't immediately know the answer to -- is not worth my time if I only consider the SE reward system (I learn something, too, but that's not the point here). There are no negative comments, so I have to assume that the answers have no obvious problems. They just don't get any attention.</p>

<p>The latter answers partially share some common characteristics. </p>

<ul>
<li>The questions were not new when I answered (see also <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/457/98"">the answers of our answer meetup</a>, few of which got significant feedback).</li>
<li>The questions are sometimes harder or more obscure than average.</li>
<li>The answers are long and sometimes technical.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are these obervations sufficient to explain the voting difference? Do people not look at new answers to old questions? Do they not read long and/or involved answers? Are shorter answers always better?</p>

<p>Maybe my answers are bad. If so, why don't I get comments so I can improve them and do better next time?</p>

<p>I'd like to understand what happens here. If my worry is warranted, this community does not reward those posts we arguably should treasure the most, namely those that require thought and time. Instead we reward those that stick to their comfort zone and answer the ""easy"" questions¹. In other words, we do not encourage people to tackle the harder questions (which are responsible for most unanswered questions) or those that require more text to answer.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts? Is there a problem, or am I overreacting? If there is a problem, how can we solve it?</p>

5,"<p>While I am learning a lot from others here at the Computer Science site, I must admit that I don't get as much out of some questions and answers since I typically don't understand the theorems to the level necessary. I am currently reading <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0910319375"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How To Prove It - A Structured Approach</a> which is starting to make the theorems easier to read, but still does not get me to the point of being able to understand the theorems to the point that they add great insight to the question or answer.</p>

<p>So I started to think about the kinds of questions I would ask related to the theorems and realized that they can be broken down into two sets; one about theorems in general and one about the specific theorem in the question or answer. </p>

<li><p>If I want to ask a question about understanding theorems in general, should there be a new Stack Exchange site for theorems and people who want to know more about writing and understating theorems, or should the question be asked within a specific site?</p>

5,"<p>This could, perhaps, be related to a well-known phenomenon. I don't remember the exact name, but the idea is simple enough. Ask a room of people what color to paint a shed, and everyone will chip in an answer; if the answer has already been suggested, it stands to reason that many people will upvote the answer they would have otherwise given. Ask the same group of people how best to interpret certain allusions in Dante in the context of medieval Christian literature, and it is likely that many fewer people will have an opinion, much less an answer, and therefore no answer - no matter how good an answer it may be - will be likely to receive as much attention.</p>

<p>Your trivial, easy-to-digest answers to simple questions were treated well, and your thorough, complex answers to more delicate questions were treated badly. I think that, as it is, the bounty system begins to address some of the underlying injustice inherent in all this, although imperfectly. That is, in order to receive a greater reward for a more obscure answer, you would currently wait until someone offered a bounty to compensate for your effort. I don't know whether there's any better, feasible solution. Some possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>An automated bounty system, so that questions which remain open and up-voted, without an accepted answer, begin to accumulate larger and larger bounties over time. Pro: eventually, every question will have a bounty large enough to attract the attention of experts. Con: the community would possibly need to be more vigilant in policing posts to avoid clutter and abuse.</li>
<li>A system (possibly integrated with the flag system) whereby a few high-rep users could vote to award a bounty, after the fact, to a particularly deserving answer. Pro: good answers that don't receive due attention can be brought to the attention of people able to compensate the answerer. Con: increased burden on high-rep users to review answers.</li>

<p>Of course few people will read long, technical answers. But I think it is nice to know whether it is 2 or 10 in a particular case.</p>

<p>There is no need to artificially inflate the upvote numbers. That would make the site <em>less</em> useful: you would then waste your time writing a long, technical answer and the system would mislead you to think that many people have read it. The current situation is fine: you get the real statistics and you can use this feedback to decide whether you want to write long answers in the future.</p>

5,"<p>The question <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2952/generating-inputs-for-random-testing-graph-algorithms/"">Generating inputs for random-testing graph algorithms?</a> was asked yesterday. My answer explains how to create random graphs with property X. Let us say I would also like to answer how to create graphs with property Y. Maybe tomorrow I would like to explain something about property Z, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I edit everything into one answer? Is it okay to add multiple answers? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't have a strong opinion on this. In a way, adding multiple answers makes it easier to structure things and also keeps answers short. On the other hand, there and titles and so on to structure a single long answer. I wonder if this is somehow wrong or abusive since the system asks for a confirmation if you try to add another answer.</p>

<p>I tried googling for the answer, but all I was able to find was <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/139887/should-i-edit-my-deleted-answer-or-add-another-answer"">Should I edit my deleted answer or add another answer?</a> which is not what I'm looking for. In some questions (usually big-list questions) the asker specifically wants only single point per answer. On CSTheory, there are examples of both <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/whats-new-in-purely-functional-data-structures-since-okasaki/1550#1550"">single long answers</a> and of the type <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/189/algorithms-from-the-book"">one point per answer</a>.</p>

<p>This comes up now and then on the main meta (e.g. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/94183/when-should-one-add-another-answer-instead-of-editing-ones-already-posted"">1</a> <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/105798/what-use-does-add-another-answer-button-have"">2</a> <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/125751/when-should-i-add-another-answer"">3</a>). It is pretty rare for adding another answer to be the right thing. Most of the time, if you have two solutions for the same problem, it's best to include them in one answer, and discuss their relative merits.</p>

<p>A case where it would be ok to post two answers is if you have two solutions which can't usefully be compared. For example, a slow algorithm that works in all cases, and a faster algorithm that requires an additional hypothesis that is common but not specified by the question.</p>

<p>One-point-per-answer (“<a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/487/should-we-allow-list-questions-taged-as-big-list-for-now"">list questions</a>”) are proscribed on most Stack Exchange sites, for good reason: what you get if you do that is not answers but items.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2952/generating-inputs-for-random-testing-graph-algorithms/"">this case</a>, I think it would be best to have a single answer, with an introduction explaining what properties you think are interesting then sections for each property.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>This is in reference to closed question:</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/3034/268"">Is the following predicate logic formula is valid</a></p>

<p>While I can understand the reason for closing it, I do have to disagree with closing it. In my view it sends the wrong message.</p>

<p>When I first saw the question it immediately reminded me of the quantifier section I just read in <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521675995"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to Prove It: A Structured Approach </a>. Specifically example 2.1.4 which list all of the combinations of for all and there exist with the variables x and y and condition x &lt; y for natural numbers. Velleman then goes on to explain the validity and meaning of each one. (Sorry I can't list them here because Meta doesn't display LaTeX)</p>

<p>So while the question given may be very basic, I personally found not only the question and answer to  be of value, but also the link to <a href=""http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring12/part1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mathematics for Computer Science</a>.</p>

<p>While the question was answered in a comment, someone else with more knowledge could have added more value with an answer. While I do recognize the question as part of a pattern to watch out for with quantifiers, I am still learning the patterns fuller ramifications.</p>

<p>For people taking this in a course with an instructor getting the feedback is trivial, but for me being a self-learner, seeing the question closed and referring to have such questions asked in a forum is disconcerting. For some it is hard enough when self-learning to feel confident enough to ask a question here or in public, but then to have it closed for that reason, it could just smash someone, especially a young person.</p>

<p>I also would dislike seeing these questions done in a chat. One of the points of SE is to ask a question and get an answer without having to read through lots other meaningless messages. Putting such questions into chat would do just that; require someone to wade through lots of fluff. On top of that, every time someone wanted to see if such a question existed they would have to additionally query the forum log.</p>

<p>If such questions need a new tag to identify them as such, then please create one. </p>

<p>I don't intend anything here to be taken personally, and hopefully haven't conveyed that.</p>

<p>I thought I would edit to make it less controversial, but no such option exists.</p>

<p><strong>Note added</strong>: The point I am making is that we need to be more open to open-ended and, perhaps, softer questions.  This site is not for researchers, unlike cstheory.stackexchange.  A question like the one above will be of general interest and will bring in readers.  It will also give us an opportunity to show off the knowledge base that exists among our expert answerers.</p>

5,"<p>I hesitated closing the question; it is a <em>good</em> question in the sense that it should be asked by a learner and discussed. I closed it because it is a poor <em>Stack Exchange</em> question. It should be asked in a situation where the asker can outline their ideas and proofs and the expert can give feedback along the way (the ""whiteboard discussion"").</p>

<p>It is true that the answer to the question implies how bad the question is here: the ""yes"" answer is minimally productive for the site, but a ""no"" answer would have needed to be more elaborate, and thus potentially useful.</p>

<p>As it is, the question asks to confirm (binary¹) solutions to specific exercises. It may be possible to edit it into a useful question (for example, ask for general properties of predicates $P$ so that the given formula is (not) fulfilled, or ask for a proof of one of the examples if there is only a gut feeling but no rigor in the OPs attempts). It is legitimate to do so after closing, and then vote and/or flag for reopening.</p>

<p>Pro tips:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Do <em>not</em> flood /r/compsci with questions.</strong> </p>

<p>If you start sharing anything and everything on reddit, the community there will get bored soon. Sharing our quality content with the world is a good thing, getting labelled as obnoxious spammers is not. Be careful not to flood the relatively low traffic subreddit with CS.SE questions, or you might end up ousted from their community. </p>

<p>Reddit has helpful domain pages that track what content was posted posted from each domain, and it already has <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/domain/cs.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one for CS.SE</a>. You can check it to see if the question you want to share has already been posted (in which case please don't post it), or to see when was the last CS.SE question shared. It would be smart to wait a day or two before posting another CS.SE question, other than not boring the crowd there, you really <em>don't</em> want massive traffic spikes every day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only share quality content</strong>   </p>

<p>Please avoid sharing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_Law_of_Triviality"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bikeshed, trivial and/or soft questions</a>. When sharing content on a third party site you are acting as an ambassador of the CS.SE community, concentrate on sharing quality questions that show you are not yet another CS forum on the internet, but a high quality Q&amp;A site.  </p></li>

<p>In <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/3245/l-apx-hard-thus-ptas-for-l-implies-mathsfp-mathsfnp"">this question</a>, comments on the question contained new information which was not subsequently included in the question.

<p>I do not mind if moderators remove obsolete comments, but they should remove only obsolete comments.</p>

<hr>

<p>Gilles, who deleted the comments I referred to, commented on this answer, and explained that it is easy to deduce that my answer on the main site refer to some deleted comment, and therefore the deletion of the comments did not make my answer incomprehensible.  That might be true.</p>

<p>However, I still think that he should have incorporated the comments into the question if he would like to delete them.  In my opinion, the deleted comments were much more relevant to the source of the confusion of the asker than the body of the question itself.  This is why I posted an answer to the question which was not really explicitly asked.  (By the way, I also answered to the question on surface, but this is only because I thought that ignoring the question on surface might be impolite.)</p>

<p>If my answer is viewed independently of the question, it might be fine.  But Stack Exchange is not just a set of facts; it is a set of pairs of question and answer, where people can post better answers to the questions later.  Now that the comments are gone, the question and the answer are no longer related.  I do not think that this is how Stack Exchange is supposed to work.</p>

<p>It seems like it is clearly within the scope of CS.SE to ask about a purported proof of P vs NP. The author isn't trying to argue anything, just asking if there is an easily-observable flaw in the proof which renders its conclusion worthless (which there is, as pointed out in a highly-voted answer). Other people who are wondering about other purported proofs could run across this question in their searches and be helped by this information (does the proof presuppose the conclusion? is a lower bound applicable to all solutions or just one which the authors explain?).</p>

<p>It looks like a fairly harmless ""check this proof"" question to me. I suppose that if we are not taking questions of that kind, it has no business here... but I don't remember whether that is the actual policy we want to have.</p>

5,"<p>This question is motivated by the following two examples: <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/3355/error-in-generating-function-solution"">one</a> <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/3362/what-is-the-complexity-of-recurrence-relation"">two</a>.</p>

<p>Both questions asked about the correctness of their solution to some problem (in these cases, recurrences). Despite one being slightly more ""fleshed-out"" than the other, neither seem well suited to the CS.SE site. This may be due to the fact that if the solution is correct a simple ""yes"" answer suffices. This results in no real discussion, as it is clearly not necessary. However, if the solution is incorrect, answers may nudge the OP in the correct direction.</p>

<p>Is there a way to massage these questions into a form more suitable for CS.SE? It not, what (online) avenues should be taken to check this work?</p>

<p>If your assignment text has been posted wholesale, that may be a <strong>copyright</strong> violation. This could only apply if the wording of the assignment is sufficiently original to be covered by copyright (sometimes there is a natural way to phrase a problem, it would be difficult to claim copyright on that). If you wish, you can send a takedown notice — see “Reporting Copyright Infringements” in the <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/legal"">terms of service</a>. Note that copyright takedown notices have to be sent to the specified email address, site moderators are not enpowered to deal with them. If the question has answers, we would prefer if it can be rephrased rather than taken down, so a flag <em>in addition</em> would be appreciated.</p>

<p>If your assignment has been posted without attribution, and represents a non-trivial, original wording effort, it may be <strong>plagiarism</strong>. In this case, please flag the post, or edit it to add attribution. If you do not have an account on the site, you can still suggest an edit to add the attribution, or you can use the <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/help/other"">contact form</a> to contact Stack Exchange staff who can relay a request to site moderators.</p>

<p>On the topic of edits, please note that an edit that adds attribution is fine (“This question was asked to the CS 142 class of Miskatonic University.”) An edit that removes content from the question or that adds editorial text such that “do not answer this, it's homework” will be treated as the vandalism it is and will be reverted.</p>

<p>If you are unhappy that your students do not do their homework for themselves, <strong>you</strong> should lecture them. It's not a problem that we can solve for you. We, as a community, will certainly not forbid answering a question just because it was asked as a homework question. You may mention the origin of the question in a comment (note that you need to be a user with at least 50 reputation points to leave a comment), or with an edit (see above). This will typically dissuade some, but not all, of the participants from answering fully or at all.</p>

<p>If you gave the question in a <strong>graded</strong> exam, you should take measures to prevent Internet access during exams. We cannot enforce your security measures for you.

<p>One thing you can do is that if you are interested in a question and the answers on Math.SE do not answer your question in a satisfactory way you can post a new follow up question here linking to that question and pointing out more specifically why you feel the answers are not satisfactory.</p>

5,"<p>I don't think it would be appropriate to ask for many different answers. That turns the thread into a list, and Stack Exchange doesn't do well with lists. Usually, individual items are posted as separate answers, and the answers are roughly ordered by age first, then popularity, then relevance and general interest.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that sometimes, there will be many solutions to a particular problem. It's ok if this happens organically (i.e. don't deliberately seek it).</p>

<p>If you're interested in multiple solutions matching different constraints (e.g. one that you can teach in high school, one that is amenable to formal proving, one that generalizes well to other situations, etc.), ask separate questions. Link them to each other in the question body or in comments.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<h3>Similar questions on different sites</h3>

<p>Different communities will often offer different perspectives on the same topic. This is why there is no feature to close a question as a duplicate of a question on another site.</p>

<p>Add comments to link the questions to each other if you think that the answers on one site would be interesting to visitors from the other site. Feel free to reuse content from answers from one site (with proper attribution, of course) if you think that content is good from the perspective of the other site — but again remember that a good answer will usually give a different treatment on different sites.</p>

<h3>Identical questions (multiposting)</h3>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64068/is-it-possible-to-post-questions-across-a-couple-of-the-sites-because-its-debata"">Multiposting is discouraged as a matter of policy.</a> If you see the same question (by the same asker, in a short lapse of time) on two or more sites:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leave a comment linking to the other version(s) of the question so that answerers don't waste their time repeating what's already been said on another site.</li>
<li>Flag the question on all but one site. Close as off-topic if the question is borderline. If the question is genuinely on-topic on multiple sites, favor the one where it has the best answers. Moderators will arrange to merge and migrate if it is useful.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's ok to ask about the same core problem on different sites, but the question <strong>must be tailored to each site</strong>. If you do this, be sure to cross-link the questions; this is useful both so that answerers don't waste time repeating what's been said on another site, and because future visitors are likely to be interested by both questions.</p>

<h3>About this specific question</h3>

<p>If the question was just “what is tail recursion”, I'd point to Wikipedia. This question is more specific, it's asking about a particular context. I think it deserves an answer tailored to that context.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>A number of questions have been asked about the programming challenges on the website Interview Street. For example, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/6211/how-can-i-improve-my-algorithm"">this</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/4941/dynamic-programming-with-large-number-of-subproblems"">this</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/6170/how-to-do-fairy-chess-problem-in-on3"">this</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2598/balanced-weighting-of-edges-in-cactus-graph"">this</a> and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/1076/how-to-approach-vertical-sticks-challenge"">this</a>.  </p>

<p>What should our policy be for these? To me, some seem perfectly reasonable, while others are not. Should we worry about whether the contests for these problems are still open? Should we insist the questions not be focused on code (many of them are currently focused on algorithms, but I could imagine they might also be focused on data structures or another relevant area)?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<h3>My position statement</h3>

<p>First, I want to make something very clear: <strong>I will not act in any way that prevents people from answering a question on the basis that this question was asked in a contest</strong>. I will not close, lock or delete a question on that basis. This goes even if the contest is ongoing.</p>

<p>Academic tradition does not recognize a monopoly on ideas, and this is a tradition that I very much care to uphold. Anyone may ask a question or contribute an idea that are not original to them. While the law in most countries, which is less liberal than scientists tend to be, recognizes a monopoly (with limitations) on a particular way to express an idea (copyright) and on the practical use of an idea (patents), <strong>a monopoly on the ideas themselves is not acceptable</strong> to our society in general, nor the narrower community of mathematicians.</p>

<p>Academic tradition does require attributing ideas when they are not so well-known that you know their source. If you notice a contest problem is posted without attribution, please do add the attribution; Stack Exchange in general does not appreciate plagiarism either.</p>

<p>As an answerer, you are entirely free to apply your own policies. If you wish to wait for the end of the contest before answering, or to report the user to the contest organizers, it's up to you. I might in fact do these too. All I ask is that you <strong>do not prevent others from answering</strong>.</p>

<p>The argument that “we must not help people cheat so we must not answer contest questions” is specious. The net effect of such a policy would be that cheaters would carefully hide the origin of the question, while innocent people (who read the question elsewhere, or aren't participating in the contest) would be penalized. If you think someone is cheating on a contest, report them to the contest organizers: they are the ones who can decide whether the person is cheating and what to do about it. (Do note that the <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/legal/privacy-policy"">privacy policy</a> does not allow either moderators or Stack Exchange staff to reveal private information such as email or IP addresses.)</p>

<h3>General rules that apply throughout Stack Exchange</h3>

<p>If the text of question is directly copied from the contest description, that may be a <strong>copyright</strong> violation. This could only apply if the wording of the assignment is sufficiently original to be covered by copyright (sometimes there is a natural way to phrase a problem, it would be difficult to claim copyright on that). The contest organizers may in that case send a takedown notice to have the offending text removed — see “Reporting Copyright Infringements” in the <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/legal"">terms of service</a>. Note that copyright takedown notices have to be sent by the copyright holder (not by third parties) to the specified email address (not to site moderators, who are not enpowered to deal with them). If the question has answers, we would prefer if it can be rephrased rather than taken down, so a flag <em>in addition</em> would be appreciated.</p>

<p>If the problem statement is posted without attribution, and represents a non-trivial, original wording effort, it may be <strong>plagiarism</strong>. In this case, please flag the post, or edit it to add attribution. If you do not have an account on the site, you can still suggest an edit to add the attribution, or you can use the <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/help/other"">contact form</a> to contact Stack Exchange staff who can relay a request to site moderators.</p>

<p>On the topic of edits, please note that an edit that adds attribution is fine (“This question was asked as part of the Algorithms Little League of Podunk.”) An edit that removes content from the question or that adds editorial text such that “do not answer this, it's from an ongoing contest” will be treated as the vandalism it is and will be reverted.</p>

<h3>Acceptable questions on Computer Science Stack Exchange</h3>

<p>Not every question from a programming contest is acceptable here.</p>

<p>Like homework questions, contest questions are often too broad if they are asked as-is. A good Stack Exchange question would typically focus on one aspect of finding the solution, such as choosing a data structure with certain properties, or finding a good algorithm for a subtask.</p>

<p>Since this is a computer science site and not a programming site, I expect questions and answers to use pseudocode more often than code in a real programming language. Executable pseudocode is nice, though, if it doesn't come at the expense of readability. If the asker isn't satisfied with an answer that explains an algorithm in English or pseudocode, feel free to tell him to try writing the code, and ask on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a> if he gets stuck.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/484/how-to-increase-our-traffic"">How to increase our traffic</a>?</p>

<p>It seems that we have a steadily growing number of visits recently. At <a href=""http://www.quantcast.com/cs.stackexchange.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> I was able to generate a plot of the traffic over time:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WHl2R.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I am interested in the explanation of this graph. First of all, how reliable is this data? And second, what might be a reason for the increased traffic?</p>

<ul>
<li>the events at the peeks (whatever happend on Aug 11) ?</li>
<li>the start of the winter term in most universities?</li>
<li>did we just reached the critical mass?</li>
</ul>

<p>Can we learn something from this?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I can not disclose details of what data we mods get, but I can tell you that it looks quite similar to what you found. Given that SE likely uses the very same data (probably together with those obtained from Google) this may not be too surprising.</p>

<p>The spikes are due to social media; see also <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/484/how-to-increase-our-traffic"">here</a> and compare with the dates <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/domain/cs.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on reddit</a>. It is noteworthy that if you consider visitor counts average over seven days, all spikes caused the (before September) mostly flat visitor curve to rise sustainably. Apparently, visibility on social media does bring new regulars.</p>

<p>As for the reason for the latest increase, we can only speculate. Winter term started at universities and many questions seem to be study-related, true, but last summer term did not cause a comparable increase. Therefore, university schedules can't be solely responsible. People with more experience across multiple SE sites may be able to offer more.</p>

<p>Our traffic by search engines is still at only 60%; according to SE folks, that figure should in the nineties eventually.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Moderators have a bit more detailed statistics. We aren't allowed to share the specifics, but I can tell you that the general trends agree with the public observations. In most available measures (number of posts, visits, new users, feedback from anonymous users, …), we have gone through three phases:</p>

<ol>
<li>The initial excitement of the early beta, with lots of activity.</li>
<li>A lull from mid-April to late August.</li>
<li>A noticeable increase since early September. Our number of visits is especially growing, and the growth of the number of posts is clearly visible.</li>
</ol>

<p>These phases are pretty much de rigueur in the evolution of a Stack Exchange site. It's likely that the start of the term is helping us grow at the moment as well.</p>

<p>We're still getting a significant part of our traffic by referral rather than by search engines, but not alarmingly so. I won't say which sites because tha tand the referral statistics are known to be buggy besides, but nothing unexpected stands out anyway.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>First, please don't carry out extended discussions in comments. Comments are intended to allow readers to request clarifications or provide complements or objections related to a post. Long discussions detract from the generally-useful comments. And especially do not carry out extended discussions in comments on a non-participating user's post: the poster gets an inbox notification for each comment that you make on his post.</p>

<p>There is a place that is intended for discussions: <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/"">chat</a>. If you feel that a chain of comment replies is going to keep going, please switch to chat (leave a last comment like <code>Let's continue in [chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2710/computer-science).</code>). You might even see an automated message suggesting going to chat, but don't wait for that automated message (it doesn't trigger in all circumstances where it would be warranted).</p>

<p>Each Stack Exchange site has a associated main chatroom; ours is <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2710/computer-science"">Computer Science</a>. You can take the discussion there. The main chatroom is open to pretty much anything (with the usual proviso to <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/faq#nice"">be nice</a> — in theory, discussions are expected to be at least vaguely related to the site's topic, but this is only enforced in a few dedicated room.</p>

<p>If one of the participants in the discussion has at least 100 reputation (totaled over the whole Stack Exchange network), xe can <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/faq#room-users"">create a new room</a> instead.</p>

<p>You need 20 reputation and a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/edit-logins"">registered account</a> to participate in chat. If one of the participants has less than 20 reputation, xe can be invited by a moderator or room owner. So the best course of action if you have more than 100 rep and the other user has less than 20 rep is to create a room, grant explicit write access to the other user on the “access” tab of the room's info page, and leave a last comment inviting the user to join you in that chatroom.</p>

<p>If you need assistance with chat and none of the site moderators are around, try <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2691/the-assembly"">the Assembly</a>.

No attempt is made at determining whether the tags are good and should remain, or whether the tags are a variant name of another tag and should be renamed or made synonyms.

<p>Keeping the computer-vision tag offers the additional benefit that when searching for the tag when asking a question, if the user starts typing ""vision"", he will still be shown the ""computer-vision"" tag in the suggested tags (search looks for matching tag substrings), while someone typing ""computer-vision"" would also be shown the right tag in the suggested tags, though it may take longer to show up.</p>

<p>I guess dropping the ""computer-"" prefix makes sense in that the prefix is redundant on a CS site. But I still feel that computer-vision might be a better option. Of course, on the issue of merging of tags, please go ahead. Which one needs to be kept is the question.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>We've had complaints in the past that too many questions were closed by moderators. And as the site grows, we have more questions in need of closing. We have a growing number of users who can cast close votes. So, shamelessly ripped off from <a href=""https://crypto.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/129/a-guide-to-moderating-crypto-stackexchange-yourself-close-voting"">Ninefingers's post on Cryptography Meta</a>, I give you:</p>

<h1>A guide to moderating Computer Science Stack Exchange yourself — close voting</h1>
",CSmeta
5,"<h3>Rationale: why do we close questions?</h3>

<p>There are really two ways to do moderation. If you've been on any of the <code>.moderated</code> newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.</p>

<p>SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. <em>Anyone</em> can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question <em>back into review/improve mode</em>. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... <em>happen</em>.</p>

<h3>Why do we close a question?</h3>

<p>The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on <em>problems you face</em> or things you are trying to understand. The <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">don't ask</a> section of the help center gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.</li>
<li>Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.</li>
<li>Some questions belong elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, <em>broadly speaking</em> true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.</p>

<h3>Is closing like deletion?</h3>

<p>No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put ""into improve mode"" if you like, and are still visible for <em>anyone</em> to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different — they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.</p>

<h3>What are the requirements for closing a question?</h3>

<p>If you have 500 reputation (3000 on a non-beta site), you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.</p>

<p>If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option ""this question does not belong here"". That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.</p>

<h3>Why can anyone vote to close/reopen?</h3>

<p>Firstly, anyone with sufficient reputation can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such, with lower reputation) because it is <em>your site</em>. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.</p>

<h3>Ok, so how does it work?</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CYWVv.png"" alt=""Example close button""></p>

<p>Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7aJGO.png"" alt=""Close vote reasons dialog""></p>

<ul>
<li>If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iDQsa.png"" alt=""Other votes""></p>

<ul>
<li>The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.</li>
<li>The ""off topic"" page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. At the moment, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind - we are collecting statistics to build a ""migrate to"" list, but that is not implemented yet.</li>
<li>The other options are straight out closes.</li>
<li>Once you pick your option and click ""close"", your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.</li>
<li>If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.</li>
<li>Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lp4Mr.png"" alt=""Close banner""></p>

<h3>How does vote to re-open work?</h3>

<p>A closed question has a ""reopen"" link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.</p>

<p>Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png"" alt=""Re-open link""></p>

<h3>What happens if I make a mistake?</h3>

<p>Don't worry! You can retract your close vote by clicking the “close” button again. This is useful, for example, if the question has been edited since you voted to close. Note that you cannot use this to change the close reason (if you retract a close vote, you can't cast a new one).</p>

<p>Furthermore, unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. </p>

<h3>Why are some questions closed with fewer votes?</h3>

<p>Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, closure as duplicate can be faster for two reasons. If the asker agrees that their question is a duplicate, they can validate the closure immediately. This shows a final duplicate close vote from “Community”. Also, if a user with a gold tag badge in one of the question's initial tags votes to close or reopen as a duplicate, this takes effect immediately; in this case a gold tag badge icon appears after the closer's name.</p>

<h3>I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?</h3>

<p>Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. </p>

<h3>My name appears on the bottom. Isn't this going to cause problems with other users?</h3>

<p>Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.</p>

<p>However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.</p>

<h3>How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?</h3>

<p>In the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/review"">review queues</a>, specifically the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/review/close"">close votes queue</a> and the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/review/reopen"">reopen votes queue</a>. These queues are open to everyone who has the close vote privilege. For each question, you get to decide whether to close/reopen or not; enough “no” votes take the question out of the queue. An edit from the queue is a vote to not close or reopen.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jvUXi.png"" alt=""phear my grafing skilz""></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Computer science</a> is a broad subject, with a somewhat misleading names because it's not just about computers: computing science would be a better name. Computing refers to applying systematic treatment to information.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Computational science</a>, also known as scientific computing, is the application of mathematical models to computations for scientific disciplines.</p>

<p>There is some overlap between CS and Scicomp, mainly in the form of algorithms for numerical analysis. But CS is a lot broader than that. Scicomp.SE is more of a vertical: it ventures far more into engineering where CS.SE sticks to science, but sticks to one field.</p>

<p>I don't know what you mean when you write “the 3 question examples seem to fit very well here”. Of the three bullet points that are mentioned as a goot fit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Software packages used in computational science are squarely off-topic here.</li>
<li>Algorithms or methods used to solve problems in applied mathematics are on-topic here (but they are more likely to find a specialist audience on Scicomp.SE, since on CS.SE we're good at algorithms but not always at the applied math behind them).</li>
<li>Modeling methods are off-topic here: they're a topic for physicists, chemists, biologists, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scicomp.SE and CS.SE have pretty much disjoint audiences. From <a href=""https://github.com/stared/tag-graph-map-of-stackexchange/tree/master/bundles_json"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">data retrieved in November 2011</a> (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/157976/map-of-all-se-sites-except-the-3-biggest"">courtesy of Piotr Migdal</a>), there were only 5 users who had more than 200 reputation points on both CS.SE and Scicomp.SE, out of 212 on CS and 130 on Scicomp. For comparison, with 195 eligible users on Academia, 16 also have 200 rep on CS and 16 also have 200 rep on Scicomp (with just 1 on all three).</p>

5,"<p>We all love <a href=""http://cs.stackexchange.com"">Computer Science - Stack Exchange</a>, but there is a whole world of people out there who need answers to their questions and don't even know that this site exists.

",CSmeta
5,"<p>One of the things I like about the Computer Science site over StackOverflow in general is that if you mention you are not sure of what you are asking people here people will tend to help you reformulate your question into something of value and then answer it. That was the recent case for me with <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/9756/268"">How are programming languages and foundations of mathematics related?</a></p>

<p>One thing I found out with some of the F# people at SO is that if they see a question of merit but that is fallacious and should be reformulated they will suggest the changes in a comment and ask that the question be closed before being answered, and then a new revised question be asked so as not to have the fallacious question appear and have to work to repair it.</p>

<p>As such I would like purpose a tag that tells others that if the question has merit but is fallacious, that it not be answered but have comments suggesting changes so that the OP can close the question and open a new question of more value to the site.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Why would you indicate a fallacy in a question by a tag? Tags indicate what the question is about: <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/algorithms"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;algorithms&#39;"" rel=""tag"">algorithms</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/compilers"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;compilers&#39;"" rel=""tag"">compilers</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/authentication"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;authentication&#39;"" rel=""tag"">authentication</a>, … Whether there is a misconception in the way the question is stated is irrelevant to decide whether the question would interest you, so it's not something that people would search for, subscribe to or ignore. Therefore it's pointless to have as a tag.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>It has become a ritual: three times a semester (around 2nd week, midterms and finals) there is a flow of simple, homework-like questions (mostly in the field of automata theory; US education system is to blame).</p>

<p>The ceremony goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>some new user asks ""Are the following languages are regular for: (1) $L={a}$; (2) $L={b}$; (3) $L={a and b}$. Sometime they will also mention ""This is not homework!""  (oh, so you're posting your take-home midterm question in SE. just great).</li>
<li>Then someone will add a comment like ""what did you try"" ; ""where are you stuck"" ; ""what exactly can't you understand"" ; ""yes"" ; ""please use Latex""</li>
<li>In the meantime, either someone posts a short answer with partial hints, or some 2-lines formal proof.</li>
<li>WAIT 10; GOTO 1;</li>
</ol>

<p>To me it seems this was not what this site is for, and all of these questions are duplicates of each other. I am a big supporter of answering (also) simple question, but some of those are ridiculously simple. 
Moreover, it looks like many users don't even try to search the site for similar question, that solves theirs as well (maybe because searching latex doesn't work well; or maybe there are small differences that render the search useless). Not searching for existing question, and posting too many similar trivial questions is my main concern.</p>

<p>We have a <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/468/homework-policy"">homework policy</a>, but it feels we need some policy to deal with this  non-constructive flow of questions.</p>

<p>What do you think we should do with this flow of homework questions?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I agree with all you say: these questions are crap and the askers (often) lazy; if anyone thinks some independent effort is too much to ask, I suggest they <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/182266/"">read this</a>. 
However, our homework policy mandates us to endure and deal with them, mostly because we can not reliably tell lazy homework-dumper from inexperienced self-learner.</p>

<p>There is a simple solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Downvote,</li>
<li>post one of the standard comments and</li>
<li><strong>don't answer</strong> directly.</li>
</ol>

<p>The last item is vital -- too many of our users post quick answers (often as uninspired as the questions), thus reinforcing the unwanted behaviour. If the question presents an interesting puzzle that deserves an answer (good exercises to that!), hold back your answer a week or two. It's immediacy the asker desires most. If you think you can give a helpful hint, do that instead of posting a complete answer (but include the full solution later, maybe behind a spoiler tag).</p>

<p>Of course, if there is a (very) similar post and/or reference question, vote to close mercilessly as long as there is no own thought. See <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/587/a-guide-to-moderating-computer-science-stack-exchange-yourself-close-voting"">also here</a>.</p>

5,"<p>We do want people to ask questions (even simple ones), but we don't want duplicates of the same question (or with multiple copies of close variants). </p>

<p>A possible way to handle it is the following:</p>

<p>For any subject that we recognize having multiple small-variant questions (like: ""Is this $L$ regular""; or ""What is the solution of this recursion using the Master Theorem""), we</p>

<ol>
<li>create a thread with exemplary question.<br>
(this will be the ""reference question"" @juho suggested in his comment). 
<ul>
<li>the question should be formatted in a way that will be very easy to search (""How to prove the following L is regular""), very simple and straight forward.</li>
<li>however the question will not contain any <strong>specific</strong> details<br>
(i.e., ""L"" will not be defined <em>within the question</em>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we post several CW answers. Each answer will be one specific detailed instance for the ""reference"" questions. E.g., each answer-post will contain one $L$ and the solution for that specific $L$.</li>
<li>new posts with questions that have a ""reference questions"" will be handled in the following way:
<ol>
<li>Immediately closed.</li>
<li>a comment will refer to the relevant ""reference question""</li>
<li>If the specific ""L"" doesn't already appear in the reference question, a new CW answer will be added to the reference question, with that specific L</li>
<li>any answers on the original post will be deleted and their content will be moved to the answer-post in the reference question.</li>
<li>Eventually, the closed question should be deleted  (Why not just let it be? because such questions are not searchable anyways, and there's no point in keeping them).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In meta, there will be one post that aggregates the ""reference questions"" in one place, so we will be able to find them fast and refer to them (thanks @Juho for this clever idea!)</li>

5,"<h1>Why am I here?</h1>

<p>If you were sent here, somebody thought that you posted your question too early, that is you don't know facts and/or techniques one would learn in undergraduate courses. This is not your fault, but for us who write answers it has become a chore to explain the same things over and over again (many such questions arise from homework, and homework problems do not differ a lot).</p>

<p>Therefore, we would like you to go over your course material again (if you are a student) or peruse material readily available in libraries or the web. Chances are you will be able to answer or at least improve your question with your new knowledge!</p>

<p>In order to help you with that, we have compiled a list of questions that are of general nature and have answers that should apply in a variety of situations. Please take the time to browse through those relevant to your question; chances are that we already have you covered. If not, it is likely that one of two things has happend:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You don't understand the reference material.<br>
In this case, the best response is to do further research. That includes picking up textbooks (the reference answers may list some) and asking focused questions on the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/"">main site</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You understand the material, but you can not apply it to your situation.<br>
In this case, edit your old question to include your attempts at solving the problem and why they failed. Then flag it for reopening; with this new information, we can help you identify your specific problem and move forward. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Remember: ""I don't understand any of this, please explain in plain English!"" is a bad enquiry. Nobody can know what your problem really is, which factoid would help you understand, and what the required scope for a good answer is. Try instead to phrase questions like ""In above proof, why does B follow from A?"" or ""I have an algorithm but it seems to be wrong for corner case X, how can I fix it?""</p>

5,"<p>Inspired by <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10071/what-is-the-local-minimum-of-a-complete-binary-tree"">this</a> question, and Ran G.'s comment, what is the ""best"" practice (in terms of the maintenance of the health of the site) for questions that appear too simple to be correctly asked, but where the questioner fails to reply to requests for clarification?</p>

<p>In the case linked above, several comments were posted pointing out the obvious solution, plus other ideas, all leading towards or directly requesting clarification from the questioner. Given the case where the questioner does not respond with alacrity (a side question is how long to wait?), three courses of action seem to be open:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wait longer.</li>
<li>Answer the question despite the apparent triviality.</li>
<li>Close the question (perhaps as ""not a real question"" - though this is a somewhat uncomfortable fit).</li>
</ul>

<p>The first option clearly is unsatisfactory after a certain point, open, unanswered question that can be easily answered or removed shouldn't be left sitting around.</p>

<p>The second option is not bad. There's a certain argument that what we might consider trivial is still useful to someone (though in the case cited, it seems more that someone didn't even read the question they wrote), and answers can always be edited or deleted later if the questioner does eventually clarify things.</p>

<p>The third option is more tricky. If the question is actually poorly asked, then the ""not a real question"" option is perfect. In this case however, the question is clear and ""well formed"", it just appears too simple to be real.</p>

<p>In this case, I went with Ran G. and answered the question, but it nonetheless seems worthwhile to clarify what threshold an apparently trivial question passes before it becomes a ""real question"".</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> A question seems trivial, answer or close?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think posting the trivial answer is the trivial solution. That is, if (and only if) the question is <em>somewhat</em> SE-good; the usual guidelines apply. If not, close as NARQ.</p>

5,"<p>I voted to close the question earlier, and I think that is what should be done. Since the question is basically already answered in the question you link, the OP should <em>definitely</em> clarify <em>what exactly</em> is confusing to him: it perhaps doesn't help the OP in any way if someone just repeats the definition, if you will. I'm not saying that this is what you did (I didn't read your answer).</p>

<p>We don't need to decide how long to wait. The OP can clarify at any point, even if the question is closed. It can then be reopened. If the OP never returns to clarify, as I understand it, closed questions get removed after certain time.</p>

<p>As it is, the question is not any different from any other question that doesn't include any personal effort.</p>

<p>Linguistics happens to be the median graduated site for the average number of votes per post.</p>

<p>Observation: among the top-voting sites, CSTheory is stands out as the one “hard” site among more “fuzzy” sites. TeX comes far behind. CS is middling when it comes to science sites.</p>

<p>My interpretation:</p>

<ul>
<li>CSTheory posts tend to be highly upvoted because they typically involve significant effort, more so than on other sites. Posts tend not to be a quick read, which makes the reader more involved and more prone to upvoting. Furthermore, the site is highly specialized and subject areas are easily delimited, so questions easily reach an expert audience. I suspect, but haven't verified, that the relatively high downvote ratio is due to non-research-level questions.</li>
<li>Posts that are easy to understand appeal to a broad audience, it's a very common observation that they tend to attract a wide audience and hence a lot of vote. This is why the high-voting sites tend to be about “fuzzy” topics where one can get involved with little background: Skeptics (where answers often involve significant effort due to the stringent citation requirement, but are easy to read and understand), Scifi, RPG, Programmers, Academia….</li>
<li>Math Educators and Earth Sciences are in early beta. There's a lot of voting during the first couple of weeks which skews the results.</li>
<li>I can't explain why TeX is above the pack for technical sites. It also has the lowest down/up-vote ratio in the graduated network. This may be a genuine case of a well-developed culture of upvoting.</li>
<li>Science sites are fairly broad. This is especially true for computer science which does not have a solid body of knowledge that is shared by everyone (unlike more established sciences, especially math). Science sites also attract a large number of homework-type questions which, while easy and widely understood, don't attract a lot of enthusiasm from many avid users. Nevertheless, science sites reach a median level of voting among the Stack Exchange network.</li>
</ul>

<p>The comparison with Academia isn't fair: it's like complaining that apples are too small and comparing them with grapefruit. The voting rate is not particularly low on CS. Of course I encourage visitors to upvote whenever they see a useful post (and downvote the bad ones), but I don't see that we have a problem.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The reason I personally don't upvote most of the questions is that they are homework exercises, and often the OP just wants us to solve the exercise for them. No homework question can find its solution in Academia.SE.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>You're worried that there is no incentive to write good, difficult answers to non-trivial questions. By ""incentive"" here you mean reputation points. However, I think the real incentives are (1) helping people, (2) honing your technical skills. If you're here just for the popularity contest, then perhaps you should only address the low-hanging fruit.</p>

<p>Personally, while I enjoy the popularity-contest aspect, I think that my largest benefit from this site is the challenging questions that show up now and then. Easier questions &mdash; mostly homework questions, as far as I can tell &mdash; get mostly hints from me now. It used to be frustrating that answers that required some thought and ingenuity were not being rewarded, but nowadays I feel that you're really rewarding yourself by answering them, and reputation is just a way to get you addicted to the site.</p>

<p>If you find yourself regularly spending hours solving questions and writing extremely nice answers, then perhaps you shouldn't. Or perhaps you should understand that doing that, you're not only training your problem-solving skills, but also perfecting your writing skills. You are doing all of it for your own benefit, regardless of how much ""official"" reputation you gain.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>this meta question just newly popped up after yuval's answer. will throw in a opinion here after about 1 yr of heavy use of stackexchange sites &amp; my subjective experience &amp; noting/thinking about reactions. think this is a very important question that cuts to the heart of stackexchange, and the modern evolving field of ""collective intelligence"". there is no real guidelines ever posted on stackexchange, anywhere, for voting. moreover even if it was posted, who knows whether people conform to it. this gives huge power &amp; freedom to the audience but also there is some major mystery there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If my worry is warranted, this community does not reward those posts we arguably should treasure the most, namely those that require thought and time. Instead we reward those that stick to their comfort zone and answer the ""easy"" questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>imho this is exactly correct, but yes, its probably a feature of stackexchange voting system mixed with human psychology. yes, would like to analyze more what answers get upvotes and which get no response or downvotes. its a excellent area for further analysis. lacking any serious quantitative analysis, we have our subjective experience. would agree—mine fits in with yours.</p>

<p>part of the problem is that very few people can judge very difficult questions and answers. there is only a small audience for these questions/answers. in science, sometimes the most important questions have a very narrow audience. this is the ""leading edge"" of research which is highly abstract, technical, and which only a few can grasp or understand. so probably people are refraining from voting out of not knowing whether the answer is good or not. there are possibly very good answers to more difficult questions but very few people can realize that based on their background.</p>

<p>people do not seem to ""reward"" votes based on how much knowledge or research they think went into the answer, or how hard the question is. they seem to vote based on whether they think its a ""good"" answer ie ""correct"". generally this also requires it be ""succinct"". it takes too much mental effort to evaluate complex answers. yes, stackexchange is oriented around snap answers. the basic voting system pushes it in that direction. its part of the architecture.</p>

<p>another point is that I suspect a lot of voting is oriented around peoples <em>offline</em> reputations or background. people who participate under pseudonyms are possibly at a disadvantage to ""real people"". also people who are elite in a field probably easily get more votes for their participation with less resistance or pause from the audience. this is not nec. a bad thing, we probably want to encourage ""high rep"" people (judge by <em>non</em> stackexchange ""real reputation/credibility"") to participate the most.</p>

<p>basically, stackexchange is only one possible architecture for collective intelligence systems. its relatively young-- less than 5yrs old. there are some other experiments, but the whole field is very young, its not much older than ""Web 2.0"" technology. if people want different emphasis/focus [which I myself strongly feel at times] then other directions will have to be explored by new pioneers.</p>

<p>one idea I had once was a separate voting bucket or axis where people could try to estimate how ""hard"" a question is. an answer on a very hard question might be valued more. or something like that.</p>

<p>stackexchange does have some flexibility however. it would be very interesting to attempt to start a new group on area 51 that might have different rationale from the beginning, ie encourage different voting patterns to somehow officially lean toward some other criteria than the conventional one. but it takes a very large group of people to start a new stackexchange.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The problem is that the up/down votes on questions/answers are quite subjective. If I see something with which I'm familiar (probably homework scale) I'll be in a position to see if the answer is right or wrong, brilliant or plain dumb plodding. I'll feel confortable voting (and the answer probably took a few minutes to compose). For unfamiliar, complex questions in my area of expertise I'll try to check them out and vote on them, but naturally the number of people in position to do so is much less, so less votes either way. Most of the more intricate questions/answers I'll just have to pass over.</p>

<p>Some measure of ""effort spent"" doesn't sound too bad, but is it ""effort spent"" or ""intelligent effort"" what we want to reward here? I'd contend it's the second. And effort isn't really measurable in any sensible way either.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, SE measurement of post worth stinks. It just stinks less than the alternatives ;-)</p>

5,"<p>I don't think there is a clear hard line where computer science ends and electrical engineering starts, as there is no clear hard line where CS ends and say mathematics starts.
CS by its nature is very interdisciplinary. CS.SE shares scope with many other sites: Math.SE, Crypto.SE, CompSci.SE, Stats.SE, etc. EE.SE is just one of these.</p>

<p>Computer architecture and logical circuits are clearly part of CS topics, they are part of ACM undergraduate curriculum, they are topics that computer scientists study, use, and do research on. I don't see why we need or would like to forbid questions in them on CS.SE (other than personal preference or interest in topics). </p>

<p>There are many sites that share scope and that is fine: different communities can have a different perspectives on the same question. The question is a CS question and can be answered by a computer scientist, so I think it is on-topic.</p>

<p>ps: as a reminder for people who have not followed previous meta discussions about scope, although we have many TCS question the scope of CS.SE is not just TCS, its scope is <strong>CS generally</strong>, <em>including</em> Computer Architecture, Software Engineering, Computer Networks, AI, Computer Security, etc.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>My view is that computer science starts just <em>after</em> the level of flip-flops. It is oblivious to whether the computer is implemented using electronics or, say, optically. I think we can all agree that a discussion of MOSFET is inappropriate here. While flip-flops are one level above this, it is still one level below even CPU implementation.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>In my opinion, that question is very borderline. While logic circuits are ON-TOPIC, the focus of CS is about the function they compute and the resources it takes.</p>

<p>The question we discuss was going to the region of low-level implementation, where the main issue is implementation and stability, issues which are not really CS. (For instance, there are several implementations for SR-FF, one with NANDs, one with NORs, and probably others. The answer to the OP's question might differ according to the specific circuit)</p>

<p>Not any logic-circuit is on-topic for CS. For instance, a ""loop"" containing two NOT gates (an unstable oscilaotr) may give EE people plenty to discuss, but is quite meaningless to the CS point of view.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it's tough to set rules. Computer-Engineering as a field, is joint EE and CS. Some questions about gates and flip-flops should be allowed, and we should trust the community to vote off/on topic accordingly.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The way I was taught -- yay, one data point! -- questions about how to build CPUs from (abstract) gates (and that includes flip-flops) is part of computer architecture.</p>

<p>Construction or physical properties of gates, on the other hand, would be offtopic.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>A good rule of thumb in these situations may be whether the question and (good) answers can be written without invoking (or relying upon) laws of physics.</p>

<p>As such, I think the question that spawned this discussion is either on-topic, or very close to being on-topic. If anything, some clarification about the construction of this flip-flop in terms of basic logic circuits is in order.</p>

<p>While I agree with the other answers that there's not a clear line between what's on-topic and what's off-topic, I think it's better to come up with some rule and try to encourage its consistent application, than to debate the scope of the site as has been done. We either draw an (arbitrary) line in the sand, or we just let the community sort it out (a mechanism which may be more in line with the spirit of SE, but which is less consistent with our historical approach to determining what's on-topic).</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Run periodic ""hunt old questions without answers"" drives? Encourage such activities more? (Yes, there are a couple of interesting badges for unearthing old questions, perhaps there should be more?)</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>interesting question! to the contrary of some other answers I would point out that low-level physics plays an at-times surprisingly significant role in some areas of TCS. see eg high voted Q&amp;A [1],[2]. physics plays a big role in quantum computing also, such as even at the level of looking at noise in gates, and error correction. theres an outstanding debate by kalai &amp; harrow on the subj on the lipton blog.[3] and TCS studies circuits in a big way with circuit lower and upper bounds. so TCS can be surprisingly low-level. in some ways it seems to be becoming more physical all the time. even deep problems like P=?NP might be related to thermodynamics in the sense its about <em>work</em> and <em>energy</em>.[7]</p>

<p>the borderlines can get a little blurry at times but imho thats one of the cool <em>features</em> (not a bug!) of <em>highly interdisciplinary</em> (T)CS! so suggest these questions be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. &amp; trust a little the <em>collective intelligence</em> and <em>wisdom of crowds</em> in the voting reflecting relevance.[4][5][6]</p>

5,"<p>I recently posted <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/11038/reference-for-arm-system-calls"">this</a> question on cs.stackexchange.com.  In the question, I am essentially asking about whether anyone can point me towards references on ARM programming.  It was closed as off-topic with the response not appropriate for this forum, and try the main stackexchange.</p>

<p>First, I have no idea what the main stack-exchange is.  A link would have been great.</p>

<p>Second, I do not understand why this is off topic.  I wrote the question frustrated that hours of digging through the internet -- left me with nothing, so maybe it was not well worded.  However, the cs.stackechange about page says
""CSSE is a question and answer site for students, researchers and practitioners of computer science.""</p>

<p>This is certainly a question about cs, so can someone explain why this is off topic.  Maybe, also, changing the about page needs to be done.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>First of all, apologies for not making the reasons for closing the questions clear. The main reason I think is that this is not a programming related forum. Even though this is essentially a reference request (by the way, there is a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/tags/reference-request/info"">tag</a> for that if you need it in the future), it is about a programming language for a particular platform. Essentially, it is along the same lines as ""Good references for C/C++/Java/Python"" etc. </p>

<p>Such questions are generally a good fit for the ""main stackexchange site"", which is <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"">StackOverflow</a>. You even have a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/arm/info"">separate tag</a> for ARM processor related questions, and the tag info page also lists <a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> as a reference (which may or may not be what you need).</p>

<p>Also, note that the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/tags/programming-languages/info"">""programming-languages"" tag</a> that you used for your question deals with ""design, implementation and analysis of programming languages"", and not usage. Have a look at the about link for more details on the tag. There is a fine line, and this question might be borderline on-topic, but in general, such questions will get good answers on stackoverflow, and considered off-topic here. </p>

<p>In the last 90 days, we only migrated 13 questions away to SO. 2 of these were rejected (i.e. subsequently closed on the target site), 1 rightly (in my opinion as an SO user), 1 because the asker deleted his own question. So we have a good success rate for migrations (I do sometimes filter by closing as straight off-topic questions that were flagged for migration but I think will get shot down as low quality on SO).</p>

<p>On the other hand, barely more than 1 question per week is not enough to create a migration path. When the figure gets to 1 per day, maybe. For the time being, keep flagging.</p>

<p>Do note that sometimes people ask very low-quality programming questions (e.g. a code dump and no more information than “it doesnt work”). We don't want to migrate these. Sometimes they ask on CS or other vaguely programming-related sites because they've been blocked on SO for posting too many low-quality questions — in those cases, even if we do migrate, the migration is automatically rejected (it shows in the question history as closed, locked, unlocked in quick succession).</p>

5,"<p>Most likely, the symptom you're describing is one exhibited mostly by vague, ambiguous and hard-to-understand questions. In particular, I think it's probably pretty fair to characterize the linked question as ""Not a real question"" (certainly it seems well-intentioned, but the current wording is unproductive). The best answers address the question that likely ought to have been asked instead: how do you prove a language is deterministic context free? Clarification could have been given showing that the asker is aware of some proof methods, but finds them lacking in some respects.</p>

<p>Given that, the solution is probably to close such questions, reformulate them as appropriate and if possible, and only then reopen.

5,"<p>Such questions as you reference are almost always bad, but it can be hard to nail down why. It sometimes seems as if you have to know the answer before you can know whether the question is a good one.</p>
<p>Here is what definitely works for SE:</p>
<ol>
<li>A question that states a problem, a proposal for solving it and <em>a focused question</em> about <em>a specific aspect</em> of the proposal that is unclear.</li>
<li>A pair of question and answer that are <em>of general nature</em> and thus likely to <em>help others</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If neither applies, we usually have some variant of &quot;this is my attempt on the latest exercise, please check it before the TA so I can get maximum points!&quot; (assumption on my part). This is bad, although the problem is subtle.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the attempt is <em>wrong</em> good answers can be given, pointing out the mistake and proposing (hints for) fixes.</li>
<li>If the attempt is correct, nothing can be said but &quot;yes, it's correct&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second case is a problem. Even if the OP can not <em>know</em> the case applies, they could have phrased the question so that it <em>can not</em> occur. Therefore, I suggest we shoot down all questions that are not 1. or 2. without hesitation (as NARQ).</p>
<p>If a questioner wants their work checked, they should be able to pinpoint their doubt and providing a question that allows meaty answers either way (i.e. for &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; answers). This, for example, would be okay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I got exercise problem A. Here is my attempt: [...]</p>
<p>I am unsure about step (*). It seems to hold because of X, but how do I take care of Y?</p>

5,"<p>I had an idea for promoting this site, and I was wondering if it was feasible.</p>

<p>Basically, I think we should migrate old theory/CS questions from StackOverflow to this site. I often end up googling questions about graphs, algorithms and automata, and more often than not I find my question is answered on Stack Overflow. This makes since, given that these questions were asked before CS.SE even existed.</p>

<p>My thought is that a lot of people will find this site by ""stumbling"" upon it when searching for a specific topic, and that we could possibly grow our community of more of those stumbles directed users here, instead of to SO.</p>

<p>Is this possible? I'm guessing our mods wouldn't have the authority to do this, but would it be worth discussing with the SO mods?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>First, we'd only want to do that for posts that have really good answers, not for any random post that happens to be about computer science.</p>

<p>Third, we still need to grow the site organically. A mass migration would not be good for us. We need to curate each post as it comes in, too — most incoming migrations need at a minimum to be retagged and have math formatting applied.</p>

<p>There is a lot of disagreement among the Stack Overflow community as to how much computer science is on-topic. Part of the community wants CS.SE not to exist as they don't recognize the existence of computer science as a science: they divide the world into programming (SO), and discussions (nowhere on SE). In practice, the SO community tends to want to keep good questions regardless of whether they're on-topic, and to want to get rid of bad questions regardless of whether they're on-topic.</p>

<p>In any case, it is now impossible to migrate questions that are more than 60 days old, even for moderators.</p>

<p>When you see a question on Stack Overflow that <strong>is off-topic there</strong>, flag or vote to close. If the question is less than 60 days old, <em>and</em> it's on-topic here, <em>and</em> it's a good question, then flag for migration — but be prepared for your flag to be either ignored (because if the question is closed in the meantime, that automatically marks your flag as helpful without a moderator ever seeing it) or declined (it depends which moderator handles your flag, they have different opinions on the scope of SO).</p>

<p>Don't go on a witch hunt on SO. Only flag posts that you stumble on organically.</p>

<p>If you see a good computer science question on SO that cannot be migrated (either because it straddles the border between programming and CS so that it's on-topic on SO as well, or because it's too old), feel free to ask it here in your own words. If you do that, you'll “take ownership” of the question in some sense: it'll be up to you to respond to comments, to mark an answer as accepted. Do link to the SO thread so that people can easily find prior work on the topic.</p>

5,"<p>I've read <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/109/how-to-deal-with-questions-about-crank-heavy-topics"">this</a>, and also run into the unpleasant situation of having my proof that I wanted to get checked closed as ""not constructive.""</p>

<p>I realize that a lot of people consider P vs. NP a ""crank subject.""  In my own mind, at least, I am not a crank, in the sense that I have some training in mathematics and am aware of what the difference between a correct and incorrect proof is.  (See some of my old posts under my other <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/1338/phil"">profile</a> if you need evidence that I'm not totally incompetent.)</p>

<p>My question is:  Given that there are other proofs, including <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10485/flaw-in-my-np-conp-proof"">NP = coNP proofs</a> that are trivially wrong (but good questions nonetheless), and that when CStheory.se was just getting started, they said that they <em>might</em> have CS.SE be a proof-checking site for proofs like the ones I seem generate...</p>

<p><strong><em>What does the site consider to be the difference between an ""acceptable"" check-my-proof question and an unacceptable such question?</em></strong>  <em>(note, they even have  a tag for check-my-proof)</em></p>

<p>Of course you know, my interest is in (finally!) having a venue other than comp.theory to try to get my P vs. NP proofs checked.  I don't belong to any elite cliques TCS cliques, and no friends or colleagues that I know know a thing about any of this stuff.  So although I realize that some people find P vs. NP attempts annoying, I am quite serious about suggesting that CS.SE should be a venue for proofs--even ""crank-friendly"" proofs.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.  Yes, this was part question and part my own opinion--I hope that is okay.  I hope that moderators and others will decide to make CS.SE a home for a broader class of proof checks.  Maybe there should be some sort of upper bound on the length of the proof?  Or other constraints to prevent abuse of the system (e.g., 1 proof a month, maximum)?</p>

<p>(And for anyone who cares, I already realized that the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10601/proof-that-p-np-proof-check"">proof I posted before</a> was wrong or at least incomplete/inadequate.)</p>

<p>I don't think you should ban them.  Merge, maybe, but I think that one of the nice things about CS.SE is that it is a little more friendly to non-experts.  As the CStheory.SE people say of their site, ""experts attract non-experts, but not the reverse.""</p>

<p>So the elites have a site...why can't amateurs have a site where some of the ""lamer"" or ""too localized"" questions are tolerated?  Of course I see the other side--it's perceived as annoying to have questions that aren't relevant to everyone.  But I think it would be nice to have a site where users can operate a little more freely...not everyone on this site has been to grad school, and I think having the ability to get a proof or algorithm checked is useful.  There is not much that is lost by having a couple of ""localized"" questions.</p>

<p>Sure you can, but be prepared to see them ignored, downvoted, or even closed. Why? Well, you have already been pointed <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/109/how-to-deal-with-questions-about-crank-heavy-topics"">here</a>, but let me summarise/rephrase.</p>

<ul>
<li>A person that can expect to solve P?=NP should be able to check their own proofs up to a level at which submission to conferences/journals makes sense.</li>
<li>A proof of either direction is probably very long and very complex (in its first version). Both kinds are unsuited for this platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I don't disregard the possibility that a layman stumbles across a short and elegant proof. Those who say so are silly, imho. <em>But</em> it is very, very unlikely, given the apparent hardness of the problem. Therefore, most experts (those whom you want and need to read your attempts) will weigh their interests and not read your posts¹. Simple as that.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>My overall but subjective impression is that the quality of the questions is not so good, but the quality of the answers is very good.  To elaborate:</p>

<p>Regarding the <em>questions</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are <em>so many</em> questions that appear to be just homework questions or other problems from a textbook that have been copy-pasted into the site, with no other indication of effort.  So many.  I find this depressing.  It makes me feel depressed about participating and answering questions when the site is flooded with these kinds of questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Many questions are extremely localized or very narrow in the audience who will find them useful.  (Perhaps as a result of being homework questions, they seem to have little practical utility.  There seems to be almost no one else other than the poster who will find them helpful, except for people who are looking to quickly find answers to their homework problems.)</p></li>
<li><p>Many of the questions are about subjects that are already covered in standard textbooks, and the questions feel slightly lazy to me (like the poster was not willing or able to spend some time in the library looking for relevant material in textbooks; if they had done that, they probably could have answered their own question themself).</p></li>
<li><p>The level of English and writing in the questions is variable: sometimes excellent, sometimes poor.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the <em>answers</em>:</p>

<p>Overall, the answers tend to be great.  The site should be proud of the quality of answers here.  There are many well-written and helpful answers.  The answers are often insightful, explained concisely, and look like just what someone asking that question would have needed.  There seems to be a large community of helpful people who understand the topic area extremely well and are doing a great job of answering questions.  (In the case of homework questions, perhaps too good a job...)</p>

<p>These are just my personal impressions.  Others may have a different impression!</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I don't remember anyone on csthoery suggesting that CS.SE should be a place for checking proofs.
Any serious attempt of a solution for any long famous open problem in math is very unlikely to be a few pages long. The length would make posting asking for checking correctness of such solutions unsuitable for <em>any</em> SE site. 
It is like posing the code of say linux kernel in one post and asking people to find any security holes in it. 
It would be instructive to try to do that on say SO to see this attitude is not particular of computer science community. 
Checking any proof beyond a page or two is ""too-broad"" for SE sites. 
At the same time, most of these claimed proofs won't be of use to anyone expect the OP, so they are also ""too-localized"".</p>

<p>Now the question you have linked to about NP vs. coNP is not a claim of solving the problem. It is someone who knows he is missing something trying to understand what he is missing. 
These kind of questions often result from basic misunderstandings. 
I myself did ask such question when I was an undergrad. 
They are fine questions that students ask and I think asking them is completely fine on CS.SE. 
They are quite different from a ""crank"" trying to solve an open problem. 
There are several signs that are useful to distinguish these. 
The two simple ones are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>they are honestly phrased as people trying to understand what they are missing, </p></li>
<li><p>they are rather short, have a few points, and are easy to answer for an expert in complexity theory. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Compare such questions by students to say Deolalikar's attempt which had tens of pages and took top experts in the area several weeks working full-time to understand it. 
I think the difference is clear.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let me add some note from my personal perspective as a junior researcher in complexity theory. 
In the following I use the word ""crank"" not as a derogatory term but to refer to people I would refer to as a ""crank"", and hopefully it would become clear what I mean by it by the end of this part.</p>

<p>First, the general advice to any person who seriously wants to work and solve a famous open problem: <strong>first solve simpler problems and get them a certificate of approval from the experts by publishing them in a reputable conference or journal</strong>. 
That would demonstrate that you understands the basics and worth the time of experts to be taken seriously. If you don't have any interesting result in complexity theory published in a reputable venue then you will not be taken seriously. The problem with ""cranks"" is that they are not ready to go through this process of gaining reputation among experts. If you want to solve P vs. NP but don't care about solving other simpler problems like say separating AC0[p] vs. TC0, NC1 vs. P, etc. (or worst do not understand these terms) then you are likely to be considered a ""crank"". 
<strong>What experts care about is progress in our understanding of the nature of efficient computation, not just solving some open problem</strong> for its own sake. 
On the other hand, <strong>a crank just wants to solve the open problem and is not interested in progress in our understanding of the nature of efficient computation</strong>. 
Let's say someone shows that SAT can be solved in 1000000000n^1000000000 without any improvement in our understanding of the nature of efficient computation. I don't think that is an acceptable solution to P vs. NP for any expert in complexity theory. 
Similarly if someone shows that SAT is not in P but it still might be in n^{lg* n}. 
Or say someone gives me an encrypted completely formal solution of P vs. NP which can be verified to be correct by decrypting and looking at a few bits. 
The reason complexity theorists and theoretical computer scientist care about P vs. NP is the expectation that it will lead to a significant improvement in our understanding of the nature of efficient computation. 
But ""crank"" doesn't understand this. To a ""crank"", P vs. NP is like a computer game that has only one level and he wants to finish the game.
A ""crank"" is like someone who wants to win the gold medal for swimming in Olympics without demonstrating to anyone that he can swim.</p>

<p>If you are seriously interested in complexity theory, try attacking simpler problems, get good interesting results, and get them published in reputable venues. 
Eventually you will become an expert and experts will be ready to consider your attempt more seriously. </p>

<p>Let me add this: 
the same rules applies to experts, 
i.e. if an expert claims to have solved P vs. NP too often 
(i.e. more than once in her life time, maybe twice), 
she would be ignored after her first/second claim. 
There has been claims of solution for the problem by experts in the previous decades, 
the difference between such experts and a ""crank"" is that they know claiming to have solved P vs. NP brings with it the great risk of loosing almost all of their professional reputation among their peers and not to be taken seriously anymore, 
reputation that they have gained over years through painful work. 
Therefore an expert won't gamble it easily. 
On the other hand, a ""crank"" can go on claiming to have found a new solution or have fixed the problems with his solution every week, 
while the simple/trivial mistakes he made in previous attempts demonstrates that he lacks knowledge/capability to solve the problem.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Posting my old comment as an answer:</p>

<p>Generally I think these types of questions are not good, particularly if the OP's answer is correct: not much learned from saying ""yes, it is correct"".
These question are also usually ""too-localized"" and not of much use to anyone else.</p>

<p>I would favor a ban on these kind of question in that format and have a guideline that asks OPs to reformat their question in a jeopardy format (we can give examples and guidelines about how they can restate it in a better way). </p>

<p>I think a better way to ask these questions can be to post the question separately and then the user can post his answer and other can post other answers. 
There are mainly two kinds: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>the OP just wants to get a approval of his answer (e.g. it is homework and wants to make sure his answer is correct), in which case it is a ""not-a-real-question"", or </p></li>
<li><p>the OP has doubts about some part of his solution, i.e. 
has an idea of what can be wrong in his answer and 
wants a clarification to understand the material better. 
In this case the OP should restate the question asking more generally for explanation/clarification/understanding of the part they are not sure about in their solution, 
this way the question is also useful for others.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If we do these then we can also get rid of these tags as we would no longer need these tags.</p>

5,"<p>This is a general answer. If someone is editing your question and you think they did it wrong, feel free to roll-back their changes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to make your question clearer. Check what the editor had got wrong and why. Extend or modify your question, such that other readers will not fall into the same ""trap"".</li>
<li>If you don't know why your question was changed, post a comment and ask for the motivation for the changes.</li>

I suggested an edit I couldn't make myself. The OP made the change, but added it in as ""EDIT: Thing X means blah"". Is there ever really any point in adding an ""EDIT"" to the question? My arguments for <em>not</em> doing this are:</p>

<ol>
<li>This functionality is already built-in to the system. When you click the ""edited Y mins ago"", you will see exactly what was changed and by who.</li>
<li>It's confusing for people who come to the question and look at it for the first time.</li>
<li>It's everyday business. Edits happen (and/or should happen?) all the time. </li>

<p>Right now, I'm trying to understand if there's a counter argument I may have missed. If not, I'd like to encourage other users to remove things marked with ""EDIT"", and incorporate the information nicely into the question. </p>

<p>Or maybe this has already been discussed somewhere? I think this could be seen as a similar thing such as removing unnecessary thanks, or adding an initial at the end of the post, and so on.</p>

5,"<p>I agree with you, there should almost never be any indication of edits. Posts on Stack Exchange are meant for the long term. Only a tiny fraction of readers will have seen the pre-edit version of the post, so the post should not be optimized for them. The post should read naturally. When you write a book, you don't write “EDIT: added a comma” — so don't do it on Stack Exchange either.</p>

<p>For the few readers who may be interested in the edit history, a prominent link appears under the post.</p>

<p>The one exception I can think of is if a question receives some answers then is edited in a manner that affects these answers. In this case, it is sometimes useful to warn readers that some answers may be partially inconsistent with the question. Do note that these are rare cases, edits to a question should not invalidate answers. In such cases, don't add a note to state the new meaning (“EDIT: I meant ‘recursively enumerable’ above where it says ‘recursive’”), edit the question properly and add a note at the end to warn readers (“Note that an initial version of the question stated ‘recursive’ instead of ‘recursively enumerable’, but this is an uninteresting special case.”).</p>

<p>now, dont really want to hassle over individual questions much [its really not worth the hassle], but just wanted to tip off anyone in case they hadnt noticed that its closed. also, there appears to be no way to vote to reopen it because its been migrated from cstheory(?). and apparently, those closed questions are somewhat <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/351/deleting-questions-with-upvoted-answers/355#355"">""aggressively""</a> deleted around here. so, expect it to be deleted in not-too-long too.</p>

<p>am not really disagreeing with all this, partly because the behavior of answering questions without upvoting them has never made much sense to me.</p>

<p>also, if anyone wants to give it a shot, maybe the question can be edited to fix it somehow. dont really have a good idea myself. to me the tone of the question is tightly coupled to its original intent.</p>

<p>note theres an obscure stackexchange gold badge called <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/badges/57/reversal"">reversal</a> ""Provided answer of +20 score to a question of -5 score."" ie stackexchange regards it as valuable to attempt to ""rescue"" poorly voted questions with high voted answers. but its impossible to achieve if low-voted questions are quickly closed or deleted by moderators. indeed, it has 0 winners on this site, and even on <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/badges/50/reversal"">cstheory</a> also.</p>

<p>so if nobody cares about the question [as votes already indicate], am mainly bringing this up just to point out a case of policy/dynamics of this site that might be helpful for anyone else interested in understanding it.</p>

<p>to me there is some small )( value in the question in what in science is called ""background or motivation"", which speaks to the <em>raison d'etre</em> or <em>zeitgeist</em> of CS &amp; the site, and for opportunity for respondents to exercise high-mindedness with not replying to a sarcastic question with sarcastic answers. also, frankly, it really annoys me when <em>any</em> questions are closed or deleted that Ive personally participated/contributed on in <em>any</em> way eg voting/commenting/editing/answering etc., especially the way they can vaporize without any trace or record to individual users.</p>

<p>its always surprised me how much zeal moderators have to close/kill various questions, which seem harmless, when in fact the main route to this stackexchange sites is search engines. (it would be interesting to track how many 404's come up due to search engines triggering on deleted posts.) they say they are preserving the ""signal to noise"" ratio of the site, but in some ways at the expense of traffic/participation etc.</p>

5,"<p>The question was closed by a named moderator who also left a comment explaining the closure.</p>

  <p>It is not very clear what you're after with your question. You seem to be essentially ranting against science, and you're not getting any answer beyond “no, science is good”. I don't see any point in leaving this question open; it might be salvaged by a major edit, but I would suggest a different venue that is more conducive to discussions. In a questions and answers format, this is clearly not working.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a nutshell, that's no question, it's a rant. A discussion starter at best.</p>

<p>Since the question was an incoming migration, closing it automatically locks it. If the question has to be edited or reopened, that should happen on the original site.</p>

<p>A moderator can disassociate the question from the incoming migration, which unlocks it. We'd have to have a good reason for it, and I fail to see one.</p>

<p>The user who asked this question hasn't come back to Stack Exchange (neither CSTheory nor CS) since even before the migration. It's likely that he won't be back. There's little value in editing the question at this point; if you're interested in the topic, ask a new question that's better written and more focused.</p>

<p>The reversal badge is very hard to get outside Stack Overflow and its meta site. 
<a href=""https://superuser.com/badges/47/reversal"">Super User</a> has 2, <a href=""https://serverfault.com/badges/69/reversal"">Server Fault</a> has 4 (two of which are for now-deleted questions). It's normal for a site with less traffic to have none.</p>

<p>I am, like you, saddened that moderators bear the brunt of the closing of question, but for a different reason. I wish more of the community would <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/587/a-guide-to-moderating-computer-science-stack-exchange-yourself-close-voting"">participate in the moderating</a>. Closing bad questions is part of what makes Stack Exchange a good repository of content. <strong>We curate our content</strong>. If you never throw anything away, you don't get a nice place, you get a mess.</p>

<p>There's something about the dynamics of the site that you clearly don't understand. Increasing the number of open questions does not increase traffic. To increase traffic, you need content that interests people. Furthermore, Stack Exchange is centered around questions and answers about a specific topic. Concentrating on a specific topic helps in making questions reach competent answerers (which improves answer quality) and voters (which improves peer review). We close questions that cannot get a good, vetted answer, either because they are about a topic that requires an expertise we don't have, or because they are not suited to questions and answers format. That way, when people discover a link to a Stack Exchange question, there's a good chance that there will be good content behind that link. That chance is a lot lower for uncurated sites. The signal to noise ratio does not come at the expense of useful participation, it boosts it.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think the replacements proposed in the question for ""not constructive"" and ""not real"" are a good move. Although the possible motivations for these closure reasons are stated relatively clearly, I think splitting them into more explicit, individual categories will help the questioners focus their editing more effectively. I also think that it might help make people more cognisant of the fact that closure isn't meant to kill a question, but to allow the questioner more breathing room to fix a poorly asked question.</p>

<p>Along these lines, it might be worth considering some sort of ""needs to be split"" option for questions that actually house more than one real question. There is some overlap with ""too broad"", but there's a notable difference in that a single question could be too broad in the sense of ""why do we do computer science"", as compared to a handful of individually relatively focussed questions, that should just really be separate questions under the stackexchange model.</p>

<p>I understand from the answer that an answer edited more than 11 times automatically becomes community WIKI and no longer gives reputation.</p>

<p>The first point is that the users should be better warned</p>

<p>The second point is that I do not see why I should keep working on my answers that are no longer mine, since it is precisely those answers that give me real work, and require originality, that gather no reward.</p>

<p>There is only so much interest in textbook answers, however carefully I did some of them.</p>

<p>Not all questions are equal. Not all answers are equal. When I answer a question that could be an open problem, I do not believe it should be treated the same as when I give a pointer to wikipedia.</p>

<p>I have always been evolving the documents I write. 
We all have our own way of working, and no one will be imposing on mine,especially a community to which I gave more than I asked.</p>

<p>This site is aiming for low quality as it encourages strongly fast answers and then discourages evolution of documents. I evolve documents in situ because it is too much management to do otherwise. And I have answered carefully enough older questions to know that it does not get many votes. And votes are not just reputation, they determine answer ranking, and thus the usefulness of the work contributed.</p>

<p>One of my major reasons for participating is understanding cooperation and peer reviewing in this system.  As far as I am concerned, this is a failure. I have been a promoter of open publication long before anyone dreamed of this system.
But I also believe in respecting authorship, not just the author's name, but his work and his way of working.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Follow-up after a decision not to do anything.</strong></p>

<p>I did spend significant time trying to find out how this site works.
The most important thing users do is answering questions.  I did not
see any information, any hint, that editing was a problem. I had no
idea that it bumped the question (I thought only new answers did).  I
do care about other people's time.  I just checked that the bumping is
mentioned in the editing help, but in such way that it does not look
important, and there is much to memorize.</p>

<p>I do understand you have to protect the system from frequent update if
it has been chosen to have this effect.  But the best protection would
simply be to warn the users. It would be so simple to have a few lines
on things to avoid in the editing help. Not to mention that any system
that can detect bad votes can obviously detect excessive editing.</p>

<p>I did not have TeX installed on my machine (I do now - I move), and I
could not know using it on the site was a problem as it uses my
cycles. I cannot tell what is exceptional. I do know I have acted in
good faith after doing my best to be informed.</p>

<p>As much as I understand that you have to protect the system, I do not
understand that you do not seem willing to set thing right, knowing
that none of the problems is due to neglect on my part, since it is
apparently the only thing in your power. Indeed, nothing will be done
to change things regarding users information, and you cannot help it.
The issue of brownie points is immaterial. But principles do matter to
me too.</p>

5,"<p>If you mean “can someone prevent an upvote or other event from increasing a user's reputation”, then no.</p>

<p>However, there is an automatic way in which an upvote would not grant reputation to the target user. You can earn a maximum of 200 reputation points per calendar day from upvotes. This is known as the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7237/how-does-reputation-work"">reputation</a> cap. If you get more upvotes that day, they do not increase your reputation. Other sources of reputation (accepted answers, bounties) do not count towards the cap and are not limited.</p>

<p>Furthermore, votes on posts that are marked as <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts"">community wiki</a> to not grant any reputation.</p>

<p>On a separate note, if a user is suspended, their reputation is set at 1 for the duration of the suspension. However, the reputation is still being tracked under the hood and will be restored as if the suspension never took place once the suspension period is over.</p>

<hr>

<p>Looking at your account, I see you have <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A8321+wiki%3A1"">three answers marked community wiki</a>. In each case, that happened because you edited the post more than 10 times; you can see that in the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/posts/12449/revisions"">revision history</a> (“made Community Wiki by babou editing at least 10 times” — as far as I know the rule is actually at least 11 times, which is why it happened on the 12th revision).</p>

<p>Each time you edit a post, this bumps the thread back to the front page, which displaces other posts. You're also imposing more on the readers: we need to figure out what's changed… and again… and again… As far as I know, the automatic mark as community wiki is there to discourage you from making so many edits. I have to say, here, it's working exactly as intended.</p>

<p>I know that the feature isn't documented very prominently. But that's because it very rarely kicks in. <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/posts/12619/revisions"">40 revisions</a> is far more than I've seen anywhere on Stack Exchange. Evidently most people, even those who leave detailed, thoughtful answers like yours, don't feel the need to edit them again and again like this.</p>

<p>Moderators have the ability to remove the community wiki mark, but we're only supposed to do it in exceptional circumstances. I'm afraid I don't see any exceptional circumstances here.</p>

<p>In the future, please refrain from making so many edits. Don't use the answer box as a scratchpad — if you need to edit every 5–10 minutes, you aren't ready to post yet. Don't edit just to fix a spelling error that has no mathematical implication.</p>

5,"<p>Your real issue seems with the fact the system deals with iteratively written answers; Gilles covered that in his answer and I commented.</p>

<p>Let me note one other effect that can happen: so-called <em>serial voting</em>. If a user up- or downvotes lots of posts of specific other users <em>for bad reasons</em>, the system will (attempt to) detect this (by a set of rules not known to us) and flag this behaviour as fraud and remove the votes. This will happen once per day (US-night, I think) and remove both the votes and the reputation changes.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think the discussion is the wrong way round.  The low number of votes per contribution is a symptom, not a problem itself.</p>

<p>(TL;DR:) In short, <em>we need to encourage more people to contribute actively</em>, and as a prerequisite, <em>we also need to encourage existing active users to vote more</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>First, as Yuval Filmus points out the number of votes per question depends on the nature of the site and the kinds of questions.  A site like math.SE has an enormous number of throwaway questions and one would expect low votes per questions.  A site like Cstheory.SE has relatively few but well-motivated questions which spark answers that often border on new research, so one would expect a higher concentration of votes per question.</p>

<p>I think the issue being highlighted is that this site has a <em>poorly functioning vote economy</em>.</p>

<p>It is difficult to build up a large active user base if new contributors are not rewarded for those contributions.  For better or worse, SE uses reputation as a measure of how much contributions are valued by the community.</p>

<p>Every person participating chooses to vote or not vote on any content.  Given the penalties for negative votes, those are infrequent and can often be ignored.  Therefore a <em>non-vote</em> on a question or answer partially means ""I don't think this is useful, or it is not clear"", in contrast with an upvote.  Unfortunately in the SE system a non-vote also means ""I don't have the time or energy to assess this contribution"".</p>

<p>So the message that a SE site with a low number of votes per contribution gives out is: the group of regular contributors as a whole doesn't have enough time or energy for assessment of contributions.  This signal is the problem, not the number of votes itself.</p>

<p>Let's check the hypothesis that the regular contributors <em>individually</em> don't have enough time or energy to assess contributions.</p>

<p>One somewhat robust metric is the net reputation effect of individual users.  Ignoring downvotes, which are discouraged and relatively infrequent, someone who has made $a$ upvotes for answers and $q$ upvotes for questions has contributed roughly $5(q+2a)$ reputation points into the reputation economy.  Now have a look at the public voting behaviour of the top users of this and similar sites.  As far as I can tell, this site seem to be doing OK on this measure, for the top users.</p>

<p>Here is a snapshot of the top five users at some related sites.  Q is the number of votes cast for questions, A is the number of votes cast for answers, V is the number of upvotes, and <code>~rep-in</code> is the estimated number of reputation points injected by the user into the site, computed as $\lfloor 5(Q+2A)(V/(Q+A)) \rfloor$.  (The estimate has to be used because the information on the number of upvotes for questions and upvotes for answers is not public, so this estimate assumes that the ratio for questions vs. answers remains the same for upvotes as it is overall.)</p>

<p>Cstheory.SE is a site with similar topic coverage, and arguably even more niche questions and answers, yet has a similar contribution ratio for the top users.
MathOverflow has very high contribution ratios in its current incarnation (though the 2.0 site will drop because of SE's insistence on a ""questions are half as significant as answers"" philosophy).
Math.SE (with those tens of thousands of homework questions) seems similar to CS.SE: the top users are busy contributing to the site, but also find some time to assess contributions of others.</p>

<p>Based on this sample of the top users, I don't think the user ratios at CS are necessarily a problem.</p>

<p>What does seem to be a problem is that <em>the active group at CS is too small</em>.  Many of the people generating activity on the site do so by asking questions in a drive-by manner.  Math.SE can cope with that because they also have a large group of active users in among the buzzing of the flies.  However, at CS.SE I think a lack of active users has caused the attention economy to deflate.</p>

<p>I did some quick manual checks and my random sample of people in the 100-1000 reputation range seems to confirm this feeling.  Recall that in a deflation-driven economy, people with some assets have an incentive to not increase what others have, because their own assets will keep increasing in value over time.  The top users of an SE site presumably don't really care about reputation since they are too busy contributing content, but other contributors would rationally stand to gain from hoarding their votes, waiting for others to vote for their content while not voting for others.</p>

<p>To check this deflationary hypothesis, more data analysis is needed, and a weighting that takes into account different numbers of people registered as a site grows, and some analysis of changes over time.</p>

<p>We need to keep encouraging people to use the site actively so as to build up a large active user community.  We also need to encourage users to spend a larger fraction of the 40 votes per day that they are allocated by the system, so that the economy does not go into a deflationary spiral.  The latter may seem unrelated, but it actually influences the former quite strongly.</p>

<p>Some SE questions and answers do get a lot of attention and votes, for instance because they appear on Reddit or HN, because they are controversial, because they require less technical background, or sometimes just because they were written by someone well-known.
However, the SE system does not indicate these reasons explicitly.  One simply sees that some contributions have a lot of votes, while others don't.
Since votes are the only form of signalling the system provides, if there are few upvotes on a contribution, this sends a signal that the contribution is not valued.
A new user may stop contributing if they don't feel valued.
So to build a large active user community (which is also a <em>prerequisite for the site to move out of beta</em>, where it has been for nearly 18 months) existing contributors need to be encouraged to vote more.  We should especially nudge people who are active contributors, yet who have cast close to zero upvotes.</p>

5,"<p>I usually use ""Edit:"" to indicate when something has changed that requires acknowledgement.
For instance, someone may have commented or said something in an answer that made me realise I should improve my answer, or a comment has been useful and I changed the question to address it.</p>

5,"<p>I personally don't really mind homework questions.  What I do mind are people who register a new account, ask a poorly worded and badly formatted question with that account, yet seem to expect an answer instantly (perhaps because it is an exam question).</p>

<p>A homework question asked by a professional or a self-learner can often spark interesting answers, expanding on the standard textbook answer.  The difference is that the OP in such cases is around to address comments and to accept a good answer, instead of leaving the answers orphaned.</p>

<p>It might therefore be worth asking SE for a stronger filter when new users post a question.</p>

<p>The current filter is geared to SO and doesn't seem effective at all to discourage the kinds of poor questions seen here.  For instance, very short questions by new users could be blocked until approved through the review process for First Posts.  Right now review seems to be a means of closing the barn door once the horse has bolted and a bunch of other new users have started asking similar poor questions in imitation of the first.  The process of posting a question could also be made to require more attention.  Right now some people are clearly ignoring the helpful suggestions of similar or identical questions that the system presents, which I think is quite rude.  It might be worth having an explicit disclaimer that says something like ""This question appears to be a duplicate or very similar to these other questions already asked: (...) Your question may be interpreted as rude by the regular users, and may be put on hold.  Do you still want to submit it to a moderator?""  Then any First Posts reviewer can allow it.</p>

5,"<p>One trouble with voting is that you can only vote on what you see and read. In my experience, several factors can cause a contribution to rarely be read, and thus not voted on whatever the quality.</p>

<ol>
<li>Late answer</li>
<li>Late edit of a previous subpar post</li>
<li>Bad question title</li>
<li>Bad tagging</li>
<li>Bad language/formatting</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two can hardly be avoided without changes to the platform.</p>

<p>The latter three, however, are serious problems which not only influence the perceived quality of our site as a resource, but also how the community works. Badly tagged questions are not read by the right people (which may filter their question stream by tags). Questions with bad titles are not visited even though the right people see them. Badly written or formatted posts are hard to read, so less masochist readers may stop reading early, or even incomprehensible.</p>

<p>I used to read and edit every single question (and most answers) up until October last year, trying to establish useful conventions in this regard. Since then, I have had less time for SE and only take care of posts that stick out as being particularly badly tagged, titled or formatted. It is amazing how many generic and/or misleading titles, incomplete or wrong tagging and horribly formatted posts there are -- and how few people seem to care.</p>

<p>Lucky for us, these issues can be solved by community moderation. Everybody can help getting contributions the exposure they deserve: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Edit titles</strong> to be less generic, snappier better related to the question, more interesting.</li>
<li><strong>Retag</strong> questions that are poorly tagged to use our ""category"" tags and at least one specific tag (if applicable). Rule of thumb: every question should have at least one tag from the first tag page (if applicable).</li>
<li><strong>Edit posts</strong> to make them more readable. In particular, introduce basic formatting (lists, math, code go a long way!) and fix crass language issues.

<p>I'm wondering, is there a specific reason we have tags for programming languages? It seems to me that having these would give new members the false impression that questions about programming in those languages are on topic. Likewise it seems silly to have only those languages when there are some languages which are much more likely to have questions appropriate to ask here (i.e. a type-theory question for Haskell).</p>

<p>The question looked reasonable to me.  I spent some time thinking about it, and I thought I had a reasonable answer to the question (an algorithm that met the author's requirements), but the question was deleted while I was typing out a detailed answer.  On the one hand, once a question is asked, there is arguably some community ownership in the question. (For example, if I'd gotten my answer in and someone had upvoted it, the author would not have been able to delete the question.)  On the other hand, I do respect the author's decision to delete the question, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Do we want the question back?  Should I re-ask the question myself?  Should we ask the moderators to undelete it?  Do we think it will ever be useful to anyone else beyond the original author?</p>
<p>Here was the text of the question, for those who can no longer see it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am given an undirected tree T in the usual graph theoretic sense. Given a vertex v and an edge (v,u) incident to v, I need to answer queries of the form return any leaf of T that is reachable from v with a path including (u,v), and no other edges incident to v? More informally, the restriction is that when the edge is given, we can only proceed in to that direction.</p>
<p>I can simply perform a DFS and return a leaf found. I think this would take O(d) time, where d is the diameter of T. However, I'd like to answer a query in O(1) time. Moreover, I'd only like to allow linear preprocessing time. My idea for achieving this was to use a DFS, label leaves, and then label edges when the search backtracks. This idea might work with some additional effort, but I'm really unsure about the details.</p>
<p>&quot;Graph reachability&quot; turned up some results, but maybe they are dealing with more complex problems. I'm happy with any method that uses O(n+m) preprocessing time and answers the queries in O(1) time.</p>

5,"<h2>What is spam?</h2>

<p>Spam is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29"" rel=""nofollow"">unsolicited commercial advertisement</a>. Fundamentally, spam tries to sell you something when you didn't ask for anything.</p>

<p>Some spam is after your money. Sometimes it's indirect, such as spam that wants you to visit a website and click on the ads. Some spam wants you to visit a website with malware that may be able to infect your computer. Sometimes spam is after things other than money; political spam is still spam.</p>

<p>Sometimes you'll see posts from broken spam bots that only have the framing but are missing a reference to the brand or site being advertised. Treat them as spam. Stack Exchange has some technical measures designed to limit spam, so the proportion of spams from bot tests rather than from working bots is quite high.</p>

<p>Some things, how ever, are not spam:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wildly off-topic questions are not spam. Vote to close, perhaps flag as low quality, but do not flag them as spam.</li>
<li>Nonsense posts that aren't clearly the product of a bot are not spam. Flag as low quality or “not an answer”, possibly downvote (and vote to delete if you have that privilege).</li>
</ul>

<h2>I saw a spam post, what should I do?</h2>

<p><strong>Flag as spam</strong>.</p>

<p>Flagging as spam is the most effective way of dealing with spam. A post that receives 6 spam flags is automatically deleted and locked.</p>

<p>Don't raise a custom flag, select the “it is spam” predefined reason. That gives extra work to moderators as they need to handle the custom flag separately. Moderators see spam flags, and generally react to them by destroying the account.</p>

<p>Don't bother downvoting spam. It's actually counterproductive for questions as they are taken off the front page if their score drops below -4. A spam flag already reduces the post's score by 1. (But don't upvote either: we don't want to risk giving the spammer privileges, or to say to the quality control system that there is something worth saving on that account.) There's also no need to vote to close a spam question.</p>

<p>Don't edit the post to blank out the spam. That makes it harder for others to notice that the post is spam and must be removed pronto.</p>

<h2>I saw a spam edit, what should I do?</h2>

<p>Most spammers post questions or answers but some try to sneak in spam via edits.</p>

<p>Reject spam edits, or edits that are testing bots, as vandalism. There is currently no separate tracking for spam and other kinds of vandalism.</p>

<p>Pay attention to edits that add links — most are helpful (adding a link to a paper or to Wikipedia), but occasionally the link is to a spam or fishing or malware site, so check the targets of links when you review suggested edits.</p>

<h2>How can I help fight spam most effectively?</h2>

<p><strong>Flag as spam</strong> and move on. Really, that's the most helpful thing.</p>

<p>There is one other thing: if other people with a Stack Exchange account are around (in real life, or in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/"">chat</a>), you might ask them to flag as well, especially in the slow hours when there are few people around on the site. Anyone with 15 reputation can flag. If you have 200 reputation on one Stack Exchange site, you get an association bonus which is sufficient to raise flags on any site (if you've never interacted with that site before, you'll need to create an account on that site by clicking the “login” button).</p>

<p>I believe my answer was an acceptable answer.  The question was ""How do you show..."" and my answer described how: it said ""I would suggest that you start by... it'll probably even give you some examples ... which you can apply to [this problem] ..."".  My answer was not a request for clarification; it was a bona fide answer that described how to solve the poster's problem.  </p>

<p>I read through <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/118582/160917"">the official criteria for when an answer should be converted to a comment</a>, and none of those apply (as far as I can see).  And there are reasons why answers should remain, well, answers: e.g., questions without an answer get treated differently, comments aren't searchable, others cannot edit a comment to improve it, others cannot downvote a comment, the original poster cannot mark a comment as the accepted answer, etc.</p>

<p>Obviously, this case is very minor: it's just one question, and not even an important one, so big deal.  I don't really care about this one case.  But I do care about the general policy; I think being overly aggressive about converting answers to comments is not so great for the site.</p>

<p>So, why was this converted to a comment?  Was it just an oversight?  Or is there some general policy that I've missed that explains why this conversion was the right thing to do in this situation?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The moderators subsequently closed the question.  I do not have any objection to moderators converting my answer to a comment, if they're going to close the question as well.  I think this topic is now moot.  Thanks to Gilles for his detailed thoughts and explanations.</p>

That will be a good test of whether you understand the definition of NP or not.</p>

<p>Ok, I've re-read your post, and I still don't see any part of it that answers the question. The question for reference is:</p>

<p>Your post is not an answer because it doesn't answer the question. An answer would explain how to show that the Knapsack Problem is in NP. All your post does is say that the asker may be able to find the answer somewhere.</p>

<p>An answer can be partial. But this doesn't even begin to answer the question. It only explains where a small part of the answer may be found, and gives some very general methodology advice.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: if you were grading an exam question asking to show that the KP is in NP, would you award your post even partial credit?</p>

<hr>

<p>More generally, I have noticed a trend towards answers that only give hints, and not full solutions. Such answers are very bad for the site. We are being too lax about answer quality. A hint-only answer is rarely useful to future visitors. Remember that when you post an answer, it isn't only for the person who just asked the question. It's also for all the people who will later find the question in the search. Stack Exchange is a questions and answers site, meant to build a repository of answers with lasting value.

5,"<p>Do we want the CSTheory.SE moderators to migrate low-quality questions over here?  More specifically, when someone posts a question on CSTheory.SE that is not a research-level about theoretical computer science, if the question is poor, do we want the CSTheory.SE moderators to migrate it over here?  Or do we only want them to migrate questions that are likely to be acceptable here?</p>

<p>Background: Of course, if someone asks a question on CSTheory that isn't a good fit for that site (e.g., isn't a research-level question about theoretical computer science), but would be considered a good question on this site, I think it's pretty clear we'd like them to migrate the question over here.  I don't see any disagreement about that.</p>

<p>The part I'd like to discuss is, should we ask the CSTheory moderators look at the quality of the question before migrating it?  If the question is pretty clearly bad (e.g., not well-researched, no evidence of effort, or something we'd immediately close over here on CS.SE), do we want them to migrate it?</p>

<p>The CSTheory moderators seem happy to do whatever we want, so we should decide what we want.  On a <a href=""https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2712/5038"">separate thread over there</a>, one of the CSTheory moderators said that our admins (the CS.SE moderators) told them to migrate all questions that are in-scope for CS.SE even if they are badly written.  Do we really want to be telling them that?  Do we really want those kinds of questions?  What criteria do we want them to use, when deciding which questions to migrate?  Let's discuss.  I'll sure they'll be glad to do whatever is best for our site, so let's figure out what we want, and then pass that along to them.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>My view: If the question is one we would consider a good question here, yes, please do migrate it.</p>

<p>But if it's a bad question -- one that would be a bad question here -- please don't migrate it here. If it's a bad question, we don't want it.  In particular, if it's a question where the first thing we would do with it is close it, then please don't migrate it here.</p>

<p>If the problem has some English problems that can be fixed through editing, we shouldn't let that stop others from migrating the question here.  If it's a good question -- well-posed, well-researched, on-topic, focused, narrow -- but has some English/grammar problems, we want it.  Yes, let's ask CSTheory to continue migrating those sorts of questions here. If it's just the English, we can edit it once it is migrated here.</p>

<p>But if it is a fundamentally bad question -- e.g., not well-researched, or a duplicate, or unclear; if the problems are fundamental enough that we won't be able to fix them through simple edits -- I think we should ask others not to migrate those sorts of questions here.</p>

<p>My rationale: I think there's a ""broken window"" effect of bad questions here.  I personally find it discouraging to participate on the site when there are <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/651/755"">many bad questions</a>.  I also worry that it sends signals to new users of the site that those sorts of questions are OK (because they may see those questions at the top of the list, before they've been closed, and assume they are a good model of what is acceptable).  Of course, I cannot quantify this, so it's possible I could be inflating the concern.</p>

<p>For an opposing view, see <a href=""https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2713/5038"">Kaveh's reasoning</a>, where he suggests that migration is more helpful to the users whose questions are migrated and where he feels there's little or no harm to CS.SE.

<p>“Should I study this or that” falls under the “just you” category. Very few career-related questions fall into the “all programmers” category. Furthermore, on this site, I don't think there's any analog of “all programmers”: this is a site about computer science, not about computer scientist.</p>

<hr>

<p>“How do computer science and software engineering relate and differ?” goes in the right step of generalizing over individual issues. But I fear that it's far too broad, and it isn't directly applicable to education and career choices anyway.</p>

<p>Every university will have its own breakdown between fields. Computer science may be bunched with mathematics or with software engineering or with electical engineering. It may be a matter of core courses or electives. There's no general rule as to what course belongs or doesn't belong in which program.</p>

<p>Furthermore, your educational background doesn't lock you into a career path. Just to give an example, at my job (embedded software development), we have people with PhD's, people with an electrical engineering degree and people with a CS/programming degree. We're all doing broadly the same job. Sure, we tend to ask the PhD's when there's an architecture to design, and the EE guys when there's soldering to do. But that's determined by competence rather than by asking people what degree they have.</p>

<p>The difference between CS and SE is a broad topic, and the answer wouldn't be useful for career choices. I also foresee turf debates.

5,"<p>Before that for me was annoying to see someone without any effort wants to get an answer for his homework from community. But right know I see most of answers are by few users which are either professors, phd students, well experienced computer scientists/programmers, postdocs or very good (undergrad) CS students. This means that good undergraduate student afraid to participate in site by providing an answer<sup>1</sup>, so he cannot get upvotes (respectively reputation) to be interesting for him to participate in. (specially if this site is the first site in SE family that he joins). </p>

<p>To resolve this problem I think is better to <strong>allow</strong> following type of questions to help other participants to gain some reputations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Easy questions : Question which are already answered by google search, wiki, first few pages of some CS books, ...</p></li>
<li><p>Implicitly duplicated question: e.g If someone understand that what does big O and recursive relation means, he should be able to solve T(n)=2T(sqrt(n)) + n. (by supposing that we already covered general ideas for these stuffs in our reference questions.)</p></li>
<li><p>What's your opinion to help new but good (undergrad) students to gain upvotes?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Pros: Helps to grow the site faster, because number of user increases, number of question and answers are increases and the site will be in search engines more often for similar questions. (Yes the philosophical question is why we should grow up? Or Quality vs Quantity? and at this time I think Quantity is more important.)</p>

<p>Cons: Someone abuses this behavior(one solution for this users is to flag them).</p>

  <p>Quality vs Quantity? and at this time I think Quantity is more important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NO. Quality is always important. You cannot grow a site by favoring quantity over quality. If you make the site boring for experts, the experts will leave!</p>

<p>It's normal for a Stack Exchange site to start out at a slightly higher level than the final target, when most of the participation comes from a few highly motivated individuals, and gradually open up to the <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/"">long tail</a> of questions that go all over the map.</p>

<p>There's no point of filling the site with questions that can be found in any reference text, because these questions are easier to find in a reference text than on Stack Exchange. The point of a questions and answers site is for when the answer isn't in Wikipedia or in the textbook, or at least not in a readily digestible form.</p>

<p>Helping people gain upvotes, whoever these people may be, is not the goal of the site. The goal of the site is to provide good answers to questions about computer science.</p>

<p>It's quite natural that an undergraduate student would start his participation here by asking questions. If you're an undergrad, don't feel bad if at first you can't answer questions. When you find a question about something you've studied, try working out the answer for yourself before reading the answers that have been posted. After a while, you'll find that you are able to find the answer. And then one day someone will post a question, and you'll find the answer, and you'll realize that no one has posted it! Then go, go, post your answer!</p>

<p>Also, sometimes there's an answer but you don't understand it. If <em>you</em> don't understand it, chances are that some of your fellow students don't understand it either. So take your keyboard and write up a more detailed, better-explained answer!</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> something that I think we can change, but it requires participation from both sides. We get a lot of fairly generic-looking homework-type questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>For the students: don't just dump your homework assignment. Tell us what you understand and how far you've gotten in trying to solve the problem.</li>
<li>For the high-rep users: don't be <em>too</em> eager in closing as duplicates of ultra-generic questions. What looks like a straightforward application of a general theorem may be a difficult question to someone with less broad knowledge, and the theorem itself may be gobbledygook even when its application to a concrete case is an exercise of middling difficulty.</li>

When they arrive from Google, what will their first impression be? Let's try to look at this site through the eyes of someone who's never seen it before, and see how we stack up against the rest of the 'Net.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/review/site-eval"">Site Self-Evaluation review queue</a> is open and populated with 10 questions that were asked and answered in the last quarter. Run a few Google searches to see how easy they are to find and compare the answers we have with the information available on other sites.</p>

5,"<p>I live in Taiwan. My time zone is UTC+8.</p>

<p>I notice that the time interval between UTC 04:00 and UTC 06:00 is the most vulnerable time (being attacked by spams) of our site.</p>

<p>I have seen the questions like this one <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/13756/630"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/13756/630</a> very often during that interval. I believe the reason is that our mods and users in north America already go to bed and those in Europe have not got up yet.</p>

<p>Today, I have seen 5 spams in that two hours interval. I already did everything I could. I downvoted them. I flagged them. I am not a high rep user. I did the best I could.</p>

<p>We need to do something about it. Otherwise, the users in Asia would think the stack exchange sites are not worthwhile participating.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Indeed, we have a persistent spammer (not just on Computer Science, he posts all around Stack Exchange). It takes 6 spam votes to kill a spam, so people, <strong><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/686/how-to-handle-spam"">flag as spam</a></strong>! (And don't downvote or edit, that's counter-effective. See the linked meta post for details.)</p>

<p>One more thing you can do to help is, if you see a wave of spam on one site, check if the spammer has accounts on other sites and flag there too even if you don't regularly participate on that site. If everybody does that, we can kill spam faster across Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>The spammer seems to keep East Asian hours, and these hours are also when we have the fewest participants. As there are fewer legitimate posts and fewer flaggers, the spam does take up the front page for a while. Indeed two of the site <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators"">moderators</a> (who can kill¹ a spammer in three clicks) are based in Europe and I believe the third is based in America. My dedication as a moderator does not extend to getting up at 4am to destroy spam.</p>

<p>Stack Exchange staff are currently working on better ways to block spammers. It's quite tricky to block spammers without blocking legitimate users, so this is a difficult problem.</p>

5,"<p>I'll say upfront: I don't think we can and should find an answer to the question in the title. But we have to discuss it to see that we can't.</p>

<p>In the comments of <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/13597/no-of-ways-in-which-n-indistinguishable-items-can-be-placed-in-m-indistinguishab"">this recent question</a>, we have an example of a discussion that I have led multiple times during the life-time of this site. It concerns the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a mathematics question, is it ontopic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you decide? Is your decision process suitable as general rule, or do you draw upon personal experience? Do you think there should be a policy, and if so, which?</p>

<p><sub>See also <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260/should-questions-about-other-sciences-for-computer-scientists-be-on-topic"">this related discussion</a>.</sub></p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>In my experience, most arguments for declaring a concept of mathematics to be unrelated with computer science stem from</p>

<ul>
<li>limited scope of experience w.r.t. mathematics in CS and</li>
<li>assigning measures of relevance to subjects according to that limited scope.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are <em>natural</em> behaviour patterns and I don't hold it against these people (a set which probably includes myself at times). But I think we can't make rules out of them.</p>

<p>I base my reasoning on three observations:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have yet to find an area of mathematics that is strictly not used in computer science.</li>
<li>Many computer scientists have to understand (some part of) mathematics to do their work.</li>
<li>Computer scientists and mathematicians speak different (if similar) languages.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, 1 and 2 imply that mathematics is relevant to CS while 3 implies that answers by other computer scientists can be more useful than others.</p>

<p>Therefore, my decision process has been:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it a poor question by the usual standards? If so, close.</li>
<li>Has the answer been crossposted and answered on math.SE? If so, close.</li>
<li>Does the question lack any apparent connection to CS? If so, inquire.
<ul>
<li>Does the asker explain why a CS perspective is useful? If not, migrate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you get this far, you probably have a well-written mathematics question
by an adept of computer science which is motivated by something more than
""I need to pass that maths exam"". Leave open, answer, enjoy!</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think I have closed many if any such questions. Most pure mathematics questions (as in, about pure mathematics and without CS intentions) seem to be asked on math.SE directly, as it should be.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Everything is connected to everything else. Quantum computing, especially the arguments for and against it, have a lot to do with quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is related to a lot of physics, especially historically. So is a question on solving Schrödinger's equation within our scope? Perhaps, if it pertains to some paper related to computer science, like the old papers on the possibility of quantum computation. But not in general.</p>

<p>In the same way, I feel that in the practice of theoretical computer science some areas of mathematics are used more (some corners of probability theory, computational complexity, algorithms, parts of category theory), and some are used less. In particular, questions regarding elementary combinatorics seem out of place; or to take a more extreme example, elementary questions on induction. At any rate, these questions belong to the core area of another site on the stackexchange network (math.stackexchange), and there seems to be no good reason for cs.stackexchange to act as a parallel site for these.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, if a particular area (a) has been part of the core of another site on the stackexchange network, and (b) new questions on this are are not ported here, then I feel like we shouldn't answer these questions, but rather point the OP to the other site.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I look at the following questions to decide if a question is on-topic (unless explicitly made off-topic for some reason by a policy):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there a good reason to think that the question is likely to receive a satisfying answer from computer scientists?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a good reason to think that answering the question requires the expertise of computer scientists?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For combinatorics questions, the answer to the first question is yes I think: combinatorics is an area where computer scientists are knowledgeable about. The answer to the second question is more complicated and arguable: the required expertise is shared with mathematicians so strictly speaking it doesn't require the expertise of a computer scientist to answer the question, but it is close enough I think to requiring the expertise of computer scientists.</p>

<p>In general, I favor more welcoming approach to questions about the mathematical foundations of computer science on CS.SE and I think combinatorics is among them. Combinatorics (or discrete mathematics as it is often called in CS) is a part of CS and falls in category G of <a href=""http://www.acm.org/about/class/ccs98-html"" rel=""nofollow"">ACM's Computing Classification System</a>. So I lean towards Raphael's answer that these questions are on-topic, being on-topic on another site doesn't make it off-topic here.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>EDITED: I added a second criterion below.</p>
<p>There are some questions which are clearly off-topic. There are also some questions that are borderline. For a borderline question between math and cs, I would use the criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this question much more likely to get a good answer in math.SE than in cs.SE?</p>
<p>Is the answer to this question likely to be useful in the future to users of cs.SE?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the first criterion is &quot;yes&quot; and the second is &quot;no&quot;, then I think it should be moved.</p>
<p>While in some sense, this is a fairly pragmatic criterion (in that it leads to the OP getting a good answer relatively quickly), I think it also is a fairly good gauge of whether it's actually on-topic. Suppose we accept the rather tautological definition <em>&quot;computer science is what computer scientists do.&quot;</em> Using this definition, a question which people on math.SE can answer much more quickly and satisfactorily than those on cs.SE, and which other computer scientists are not going to be interested in, is clearly mathematics rather than computer science, because mathematicians can do it, while computer scientists can only do it with difficulty and are not that interested in doing it.</p>
<p>For the question which set off this discussion, it had to wait a week before it got answered in cs.SE. There were already several duplicate and near-duplicate questions in math.SE. So by that criterion, I would consider it off-topic. There are some mathematics questions which are just as likely to be answered by computer scientists as by mathematicians; these we should leave open.</p>
<p>If a question is borderline between computer science and an area which doesn't have a good stackexchange site, I'd be in favor of leaving it open.</p>

There's another stackexchange site that might be a slightly better fit?  Is there a place for a non-specific computer science site, or should we break off a whole bunch of sub-topics (cryptography, numerical methods, software engineering?)

Do you think there should be a policy, and if so, which?</p>

<li>Software engineering is on-topic.</li>
<li>Machine vision, image processing, etc. are on-topic.</li>

<p>In response to D.W.'s comment, let's consider the question titled ""Who serves the best pizza in San Jose?"" with regard to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"" rel=""nofollow"">utility</a> costs/benefits to StackExchange as a whole. Let:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>c</code> be the non-negative utility cost incurred by a user taking the time to Click on the question, read it, and formulate a response.</li>
<li><code>a</code> be the utility benefit granted by a question being Answered.</li>
<li><code>d</code> be the utility benefit granted by Discouraging future low-value questions, thus not wasting productive members' time</li>
</ul>

<p>As a user contributing to StackExchange I have a number of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">strategies</a> to employ:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>s1 = 0</code>. I take one look at that title and never even click it.</li>
<li><code>s2 = a-c</code>. Well this is an easy question. Grande Pizzeria-Ristorante on 4th and San Carlos.</li>
<li><code>s3 = d-c</code>. I take the time to reply, by saying that they should not be posting such a question. </li>
<li><code>s4 = a+d-c</code>. I reply that while I believe Grande Pizzeria-Ristorante on 4th and San Carlos is best, pizza is not my expertise and they may be better served asking on <a href=""http://pizza.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pizza.stackexchange.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly <code>s3</code> is only viable if <code>d&gt;c</code>. But, the value of <code>d</code> is dependent on this strategy actually causing productive StackExchange members to spend less of their time on low-value questions. If the vast majority of users employ <code>s1</code>, then <code>d</code>'s value is negligible, giving <code>s3</code> a negligible if not negative value. If even one user employs <code>s2</code>, then the discouragement <code>d</code> is zeroed (or at least made negligible), which again makes <code>s3</code> a negligible if not negative value.</p>

<p>In choosing between <code>s2</code> and <code>s3</code>, is <code>d&gt;a</code>? Probably not. Future arrivals are almost certainly not going to search for the pizza question and decide against asking a beer question; we can expect <code>d</code> to near-zero. Granted, <code>a</code> is also very low in value because it is improbable anyone is going to reference cs.stackexchange.com for their own pizza questions, but at least <em>someone's</em> getting good pizza tonight.</p>

<p><code>s4</code> slightly raises our <code>c</code>, but is nonetheless going to be better than either <code>s2</code> or <code>s3</code>. Is it better than <code>s1</code>? That depends on how big <code>c</code> is. For a pizza question, I can whip out an <code>s4</code> response in 20 seconds. For a computer engineering question, I could spend hours or even days trying to figure it out (an <code>s4</code> response), or I can give them my immediate thoughts and a link to the computer engineering StackExchange (also an <code>s4</code> response, but with a much lower <code>c</code>).</p>

<p>Nowhere in this does a response like ""Sorry this is CS and that's not a CS question"" look valuable. Especially when you consider that there is a hidden cost: it makes us look like not-nice people :(</p>

Here's how it is useful: it is useful for me to identify resources that I can point new users to.

We've identified a handful of topics that often seem to get asked (how do I prove that a language is/isn't regular, how do I compare functions using big-O notation, etc.).
Folks have written one very good question and answer on that topic: a reference question.
Then, whenever anyone asks about that topic, they can be pointed to that reference question; if their new question is already answered by the reference question, we can close their question as a dup of the reference question.</p>

<p>So far, so good.  No special tag needed.  But here's where  I find the tag useful.  I don't have a list of all reference questions in my head.  Often, I recall that there's an excellent reference question on the topic, and I want to search for it so I can point someone to it (or close a question as a dup of it), but finding it is a pain.  Because we have the tag, I can just search on that tag, and then I will quickly find the reference question.</p>

<p>So, yes, the tag is useful, and we should not nuke the tag.  The meaning of <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-question"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reference-question&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reference-question</a> is basically: this is a FAQ (a frequently-asked-topic); here's a question that we think gives an excellent overview.</p>

<p>If the tag exists, we should be a bit selective about how the tag <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-question"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reference-question&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reference-question</a> is used.  We should only use the tag where we think it fits the criteria above.</p>

<p>The BFS vs DFS question is, in my opinion, not a good example of something that the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-question"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reference-question&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reference-question</a> tag should be used for.  There is no evidence that this is a frequently asked question, no evidence that we'd want to use the BFS vs DFS question as a frequent dup target, and it doesn't provide a good overview that will answer many questions all in one go.  It's just totally different from the other actual reference questions.</p>

<p>That said, if others want to get rid of the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-question"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reference-question&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reference-question</a> tag, I'm fine with that.  I'd prefer to keep it because I find it handy and I use it frequently, but I won't stand in the way of removing it.  But in any case, let's not pollute it by adding the tag to questions that don't fit the criteria.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Two questions have emerged here.</p>

<h2>Which questions are suited to be a reference?</h2>

<p>I think we agree that a reference question should have</p>

<ul>
<li>general character,</li>
<li>cover lots of potential questions (in particular exercise problems) and</li>
<li>have excellent answers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether any given question fulfills these criteria is obviously a subjective matter. I don't think there is a shortcut to discussion on Meta for contentious cases.</p>

<p>So far, I have been adding question to <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/599/reference-answers-to-frequently-asked-questions"">the list</a> at my own discretion (with some help from <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/users/157/ran-g"">Ran G.</a>); you may decide for yourself how good a job I have done. I certainly invite everyone interested to propose new questions and/or monitor the list (and, if we decide to keep it, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-question"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reference-question&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reference-question</a>) in order to help ensuring the quality of this list (and the tag).</p>

<h2>Should we have a tag for reference questions?</h2>

<p>I think <em>no</em> for several reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's a <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/"">meta tag</a>. It does not aid in searches, it fools the ""related questions"" mechanic and takes up a valuable tag slot.</li>
<li>It easily can and is being mis-applied. I have seen (and fixed) several <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reference-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reference-request</a> posts using <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-question"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reference-question&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reference-question</a> instead.<br>
(This could be amended by renaming the tag; <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/faq"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;faq&#39;"" rel=""tag"">faq</a> has been proposed.)</li>
<li>If the tag is to be useful, it has to be only on high-quality questions.
This is hard to control without looking at every single question posted ever.</li>
<li>Newcomers won't know about it, so it does not give automatic benefits.</li>
</ul>

<p>All good things the tag <em>can</em> possibly do are also achieved by <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/599/reference-answers-to-frequently-asked-questions"">the existing list of reference questions</a> with none of the disadvantages. It's a nicer place to point newcomers to, too, given its structure and introductory text.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>There are some groups of question on the site which are not tagged well, especially outside of ""core"" TCS (which we have covered pretty well, I think).</p>

<p>One of these are questions about <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lambda-calculus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lambda-calculus&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lambda-calculus</a>. Many questions have only the main tag, or maybe tags about other concepts if the question is a comparative one.</p>

<p>Can we tag these questions better? In particular, there are quite some that involve transforming λ-terms into each other; I think these should have their own ""technique"" tag (similar to <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reductions"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reductions&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reductions</a> which does not quite apply here).</p>

<p>I would ask users knowledgeable in this area to propose a (small) set of tags that can help differentiate the space of λ-calculus questions better. Attempts at generalisation so tags can be used for many calculi (e.g. π-calculus, μ- calculus) are appreciated.</p>

<p>Ideally, suggestions would contain (stubs for) tag wikis, too.</p>

5,"<p>(I'm not an expert on lambda calculus, but I was taught by one.)</p>

<p>I don't think our questions about lambda calculus are particularly badly tagged.</p>

<p>I've retagged one question which only had the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lambda-calculus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lambda-calculus&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lambda-calculus</a> tag. The remaining questions which are only tagged <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lambda-calculus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lambda-calculus&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lambda-calculus</a> or only <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/logic"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;logic&#39;"" rel=""tag"">logic</a> <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lambda-calculus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lambda-calculus&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lambda-calculus</a> are about elementary to absolute-beginner considerations of beta-reductions (and sometimes eta-reductions) between lambda terms and encoding of data structures such as Church numerals (with <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/13624/is-there-a-one-point-combinator-which-does-not-apply-any-of-its-arguments-to-an"">one exception</a> which I've just closed as unclear).</p>

<p>I don't see much room for more precise tags for the bulk of these questions. Here are candidate tags that could complement <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lambda-calculus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lambda-calculus&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lambda-calculus</a> for which at least one question exists on the site:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/beta-reduction"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;beta-reduction&#39;"" rel=""tag"">beta-reduction</a> strikes me as useless because it's practically synonymous with <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lambda-calculus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lambda-calculus&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lambda-calculus</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Going in the other direction, some of these very elementary <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lambda-calculus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lambda-calculus&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lambda-calculus</a> questions are really about term rewriting, as they are simply about applying the beta reduction rule. We have a tag for that, or rather two which I've just merged (not sure about the direction): <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/term-rewriting"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;term-rewriting&#39;"" rel=""tag"">term-rewriting</a> = <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rewriting-systems"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;rewriting-systems&#39;"" rel=""tag"">rewriting-systems</a>. I think this is the “technique” tag that you envision. But these elementary questions are not very interesting to people interested in rewriting systems in general.</p>

<p>I don't see any room for general aspects of rewriting systems that would lead to other tags being applied to any existing <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lambda-calculus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lambda-calculus&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lambda-calculus</a> question.</p>

<p>Incidentally, when I see <em>reductions</em>, I always think of rewriting systems first. Using the tag name <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reductions"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reductions&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reductions</a> for the use in complexity and computability theory feels strange to me.

5,"<p>I just want to summarize discussion from my point of view, since seems this is still an open problem <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/"">here</a>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graphs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graphs&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graphs</a> is not suitable to express a question in graph theory, i.e graph is a general term not scientific name and can be used for charts or even in graphic design, functions, ..., which are not related to computer science. e.g how to draw this graph with tikz is not a graph theory or computer science related but is graph related. Because of three main reasons I want to propose to use tag <em>synonym</em> for this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Everyone who works on graph-theory expects to see <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graph-theory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graph-theory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graph-theory</a> for questions which are related to algorithms, complexity classes, ... of graphs. e.g there is no <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graphs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graphs&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graphs</a>  in CSTheory but there are specific tags like <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/planar-graphs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;planar-graphs&#39;"" rel=""tag"">planar-graphs</a>, ... which are more specific and is not comparable with general term <em>graph</em> which causes to misinterpreting. </p></li>
<li><p>Currently all questions that I saw them and tagged by graphs are related to <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graph-theory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graph-theory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graph-theory</a> + something or without graph theory just by using other tags. Generally, if some question tagged with <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graphs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graphs&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graphs</a>, and is not possible to change it to <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graph-theory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graph-theory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graph-theory</a> + other tags, means is not computer science problem, it's math, graphic, painting, ... , by writer's understanding and knowledge about CS.SE, we don't have any evidence against this.<sup>1</sup></p></li>
<li><p>New people in graph theory or computer scientist who does not work on graph theory related topics, may call <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graph-theory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graph-theory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graph-theory</a> as <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graphs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graphs&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graphs</a>. So for fixing terminology, I would suggest to use tag synonym to change graph/s to <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graph-theory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graph-theory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graph-theory</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><sub>1. If anyone thinks there is a question with graph tag and cannot be expressed by other tags, is better to share it here.</sub></p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think we should keep the tag (or a similar tag). </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most of the questions now tagged as reference questions are likely to be asked by students of an automata theory/formal languages class. So if they find a question about regular languages, it's not bad pointing them to our reference question ""P vs. NP"", because they're likely to ask such a question a few weeks later. So our current reference questions are, in some sense, semantically related. However, we could just introduce a focused ""beginners"" tag for this purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Tagging is an <em>automatic</em> way to point from one reference question to the list of reference questions. IMHO, the tiny text with a link to the reference list is rather ugly and only some reference questions even have this text. The best solution for this purpose would be a special check box like the one for community wiki and a slightly different design for reference questions. However, this violates to some extend the philosophy of SE (content shall be featured by votes, not by authorities) and may be useless on larger sites (30k featured questions is like no featured question).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>By the way: The reason why I started tagging questions was, that I  erroneously thought <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/11209/what-are-common-techniques-for-reducing-problems-to-each-other"">this question</a> was tagged as ""reference-question"" by <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/98/raphael"">Raphael</a> and he thus changed his mind on meta-tagging.</p>

<p>If your opinion of a question is “this guy should do his own homework instead of dumping it on us”, that's a prime case of “does not show any research effort”, and a downvote is perfectly consistent with the guidelines.</p>

<p>As per our <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/468/homework-policy"">homework policy</a>, homework questions are accepted.

<p>This site stays as a personal reminder to me of how I suck at gauging the potential of site proposals. It's doing REALLY WELL.</p>
<p>I particularly love how engaged and self-critical the community is here - quality appears to stay reasonably high even in the face of WAVES of students asking homework questions, lazy questions and bogus answers criticized and down-voted.</p>
<p>It isn't <em>quite</em> ready to graduate, but realistically the only thing holding it back is that the distribution of folks at various upper rep-levels hasn't quite caught up yet (the start of the school year this fall has produced a huge increase in activity) - I fully expect this to resolve itself in the next few months.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>When it's ready.</p>
<p>To be clear: this site is doing <em>very</em> well so far. Not just by the numbers, but in how the folks here conduct themselves and handle increasing amounts of traffic (as we've seen over the past couple of months with the start of the school year). I've written a bit more about this <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/701/lets-get-critical-aug-2013-site-self-evaluation/746#746"">here</a>.</p>
<p>So what are we waiting for?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So from this point forward, the graduation date of a site will depend heavily on having enough users with sufficient reputation to properly lead and govern the site. It’s much more important to graduate a site when it has become self-sustaining, and has established a healthy community of avid users, closers, and editors — rather than imposing an arbitrary 90-day limit.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iNjAw.png"" alt=""first questions by month"" /></p>

They're making the most of it. That's awesome - but it also means y'all have a lot more new folks around, and the distribution of reputation (and associated privilege) is a little bit skewed.</p>
<p>Assuming you have no major problems handling the traffic and associated new-user problems (potential drop in the quality of Q&amp;A, etc), I see no reason why this site couldn't graduate in the near future.

5,"<p>I have seen an increasing number of questions where the author takes a scan/screenshot of part of their textbook and includes this image in their question.  Typically, the image contains some exercise they want us to solve, but it could be anything, such as an algorithm or theorem or statement from the book that they want help understanding.</p>

<p>When the core of the question is only contained in an image, one big disadvantage is that question can't be found easily by search.  None of the text in the image will be searchable.  If the substance of the question is present only in an image, and not in text, then it makes it very hard for others to find the question.  That's bad for others who might be interested in the same question, because it means they can't benefit from the knowledge here.  And, it's bad for the site, because it means the site loses a chance to attract people through Google search.  A significant fraction of our community probably comes from people who searched for something in a search engine, found a link to a question here, and decided to participate more in the site.  Questions whose content is buried inside an image are not indexable and will not help attract traffic to the site.  So, it seems like these kinds of questions are at odds with the StackExchange goals.</p>

<p><strong>My question to the community.</strong> How do we feel about questions where the technical substance of the question is contained solely or primarily in an image/scan, rather than in text?</p>

<p>Should we establish a site policy that discourages or forbids questions of those form?   Is there a consensus among the community that those kinds of questions are problematic?  If so, how should we handle them?   Should we establish a site policy that questions whose technical content is found only in a scanned image will be closed?  Should we establish a site policy that, as a general rule, question-authors should be re-typesetting the information in text or Mathjax/Latex, rather than including it as an image?   What do folks here think?</p>

<hr>

<p>References: I've found some discussion of this sort of issue on the main Meta site (Meta.SO), e.g., <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/141752/160917"">How to handle images containing text (vs text)?</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/155600/160917"">Allowed to post scanned page from text book on SE</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/116050/160917"">Using only an image as an answer?</a>.  The reaction there to this sort of practice seems to be uniformly negative.  Do we agree?  Should we establish a site policy against this practice?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>TL,DR: me too.</p>

<p>Posting a scan of the text in a textbook or worksheet is a low in laziness. (I'd say a new low but I've seen that before on SE.) That right there can justify a downvote.</p>

<p>A scan of a <em>figure</em> can be ok, as long as it has accompanying text that explains the problem. For example, this is an appropriate question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the text in <em>book reference</em> says <em>blah</em> but as I understand the figure (scanned below) it means <em>something different</em>, what gives?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But scanning text is not appropriate. It's not just a matter of plagiarism (which can be an issue, but it's generally considered ok to redistribute the substance of an exercise without attribution when the exercise is a simple application of a concept) or copyright (I think citing one exercise with the purpose of asking help solving it generally falls under the citation exemption of copyright law) or laziness (laziness that doesn't affect other people is fine). Posting text inside an image is not good because it is <strong>not searchable</strong>, whereas Stack Exchange posts are meant to be useful to future visitors, and that usefulness starts with said future visitors being able to find the post. Also, people who are <strong>blind</strong> or have very bad eyesight cannot read images.</p>

<p>Even without a site policy, I think you can apply the same rule as for external links. A question must be self-contained: information provided in external links should be incidental to the question (e.g. background explanations that a subject expert would not need). It's legitimate to close a question as incomplete (which falls under <em>unclear what you're asking</em>) if it requires the linked information to make sense (though if possible you are encouraged to edit the question to add the linked information, in preference to closing, if you can). You could say that a question is only worth its actual content. Similarly, a question is only worth its <em>searchable</em> content, so information in images must be accompanied with enough search fodder in text.</p>

<p>I don't think we need an official site policy, let alone a special close reason. Either edit (if you find the question interesting enough to bother) or vote to close as unclear, and leave a comment.</p>

<hr>

<p>By the way, why I don't think this is a site-specific policy as such (it's implied by the goals of Stack Exchange), I (as a moderator) am now applying the policy that a question that crucially relies on scanned text is not welcome, and I close such questions as “unclear what you're asking” with an explanatory comment linking to this thread and offering to reopen when the text has been typed in.</p>

5,"<p>Good question!  Unfortunately, there is no 100% consensus surrounding what the policy should be.  Some advocate that of course we should encourage useful edits, others argue that we should discourage people from making many edits.  I'll just give my personal opinion.  Everything from here on is my view only.</p>

<p>tl;dr: I think moderators should grant all requests to remove auto-c.w. status as long as there is no pattern of abuse (e.g., too many trivial/insignificant edits).</p>

<p><strong>Encourage substantive edits.</strong> My belief is that of course we should encourage all substantive edits that improve the post.  Part of encouraging such edits is to ensure that moderators ""have your back"": if a sequence of such edits triggers auto-conversion to community wiki, then in my view, of course moderators should be happy to remove the c.w. status (just flag it for them).  That's what I'd like to see happen, anyway.</p>

<p>Justification: our mission is to create a repository of high-quality questions and answers that will be useful to many others.  Therefore, edits that improve the quality of questions or answers serve that mission and should be encouraged.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid trivial edits.</strong> However, one thing everyone seems to agree on is that you should avoid making edits for the purpose of ""bumping"" your post to the front page.  That is universally viewed as abusive.  If you ever find yourself tempted to make a tiny edit to get your post more attention or to push it back onto the front page, you know you've gone overboard -- absolutely do not do that.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not directly measurable for anyone else.  We can't read your mind and divine what your purpose was.  Therefore, we have to assess your edits based upon their content.  For this reason, it is best to err on the side of making significant, substantial changes to your post -- that way, no one can argue that you made a tiny tweak just to bump the post.</p>

<p>In my view, if you're making substantive changes that improve the post -- even if it is something as minor as adding an additional citation to the literature, clarifying the post in response to a comment, adding an extension you thought up on the walk home, or editing to clarify an imprecision you noticed on re-reading your post -- then moderators ought to grant all requests to remove auto-c.w.  But if you're repeatedly making minor changes -- e.g., fixing an inconsequential spelling error, making minor changes to the formatting, adding bold tags, etc. -- then you are now in the grey zone and moderators might reasonably deny such requests.</p>

<p><strong>Make the first draft count.</strong> As a general practice, I also encourage you to make a reasonable effort to make the first draft be as good as you can make it.  Proof-read your question/answer using the preview pane before posting it.</p>

<p>You don't have to go overboard.  You don't need to draft it offline and sit on it for a day (or re-read it obsessively) before posting.  We don't want to discourage you from posting an answer.</p>

<p>But at the same time, don't use the ability to edit posts as an excuse for posting a useless first draft.  On high-traffic sites like Stack Overflow, I've seen some people first post a one-sentence answer, then repeatedly make many small edits to add to their post, in hopes of getting the first answer in and getting free upvotes that way (the ""Fastest Gun in the West"" phenomenom).  I rarely see that here, so I probably don't need to mention it -- but I think it is generally best to avoid that practice.  If you do do that, don't be surprised if the moderators are less open to requests to remove c.w. status.</p>

<p><strong>Requiring people to edit offline.</strong> I would not suggest we ask people to draft their answer offline, as a condition of removing auto-c.w. status.  I don't think it's our place to dictate workflow to authors.  Some might be happy to draft their answers offline, but others might find that less attractive.  I wouldn't want to drive away people from contributing good content -- I don't think that's something we as a community should be doing, and I don't think we should hold the ""c.w.-removal"" hostage to such conditions.</p>

<p>I think it's perfectly fine to mention to people that, if they want to avoid auto-conversion to c.w., one approach is to draft answers offline and wait to make edits so they can batch them up -- but I don't think we should make this a condition of ""c.w.-removal"".</p>

<p>I understand this is consistent with how our moderators are already handling things, which is great.</p>

<p><strong>Your specific case.</strong> Your answer is a textbook case of a reason why moderators should be delighted to remove auto-c.w. status if it gets triggered by one of your edits.  Your answer is fantastic, detailed, a real gem.  I wish I could upvote it a dozen times.  It sets an absolutely fantastic atmosphere for this site -- I wish we could have more answers that were one-tenth as comprehensive and helpful as your answer.</p>

<p>Yes, you made many small edits to your answer.  However, each edit that I looked at was substantive and did improve the answer -- and any answer of this extreme length creates more opportunities for improvement and thus is more likely to run into the threshold for c.w.-conversion.  If editing a figure triggered auto-conversion to c.w., all you'd need to do is flag it for moderator attention and ask them to undo the c.w. status -- I would certainly hope that moderators would gladly grant your request.  (If such a request was denied, I would be up in arms and extremely upset!)  It sounds like the moderators are happy to do this.</p>

5,"<p>Good question!</p>

<p>I don't think you should publicly call attention to the fact that the author is question-blocked, as that may be sensitive and may make some authors feel like they've been publicly called out or publicly punished, which isn't good.  Presumably, question-blocking is intended is intended to maintain site standards (and possibly to give people a time-out), not to publicly shame the affected people.  Public shaming is more serious than privately blocking them from posting questions.</p>

<p>If the author is the one who requested the migration, it seems fine to leave it up to your discretion whether to try to find some way to privately notify the author about the situation (not sure if you even have any mechanism to do that -- super-ping, maybe?), or not.  If someone else requested the migration, I wouldn't even bother with that.  If you were going to migrate the question because it isn't suitable here, I would suggest just closing the question here and leaving it at that.  If the question is on-topic here, then it seems like the obvious course of action is to leave it open here.  I suspect now I'm saying things that are completely obvious.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions which also contain a proof or a solution that needs to be checked for correctness and completeness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are currently 22 questions tagged in this way.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this risks leading users  to the (incorrect) impression that it's OK to ask a question where you present an exercise, show your solution, and ask whether the solution is correct and complete.  (Apparently <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/18052/rules-regarding-chomsky-normal-form-cnf-grammars#comment36280_18052"">at least one user</a> seems to have drawn this inference.)</p>

<p>Given the existence of this tag, it'd be completely understandable if users drew that inference -- but in fact, posting your solution to an exercise and asking others to grade it <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/597/755"">is out of scope for this site</a>.  It could be OK to ask a <em>specific</em> question about a <em>specific</em> aspect of your answer to an exercise (though even then it is often better to see if you can extract a more general conceptual question that's more likely to be helpful to others, if possible), but it's not OK to post your problem, post your solution, and ask others if your solution is correct and complete.</p>

<p>So, I suggest we eliminate the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/check-my-proof"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;check-my-proof&#39;"" rel=""tag"">check-my-proof</a> tag.</p>

<p>(If you agree with my proposal, I'd suggest a procedure along the following lines: I suggest we review all of the 22 questions currently tagged with that, evaluate them to see if they are in-scope for this site, close them if not, and in either case, remove the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/check-my-proof"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;check-my-proof&#39;"" rel=""tag"">check-my-proof</a> tag.  While we're at it, let's look for other opportunities to improve those questions.  Then, once we've eliminated all questions tagged that way, we can blacklist the tag.)</p>

<p>My instinctive reaction is that this is not a reason to close the question.  Part of the purpose of Stack Exchange is to build up a repository of questions and answers. Even if the person asking today is rude, some polite person might want to know the answer tomorrow.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is a strong tendency (which I largely support) to close questions that are just homework dumps.  At the very least, such a question is likely to be met with ""What did you try? Where did you get stuck?"" (and quite likely by me). This also seems to be reacting to the attitude of the asker (laziness), rather than to actual content of the question. Also, many obvious homework questions are closed because ""It is unclear what you are asking"", which is often unhelpful: if somebody posts the question, ""Can you prove that [some given language] is not regular?"" it's manifestly clear what they're asking.</p>

<p>Are we being inconsistent here? I'm having a hard time separating these two cases in my head. I suppose the point is that most homework questions can be closed as being bad questions since either the answer is already widely available (e.g., reductions between NP-complete problems) or the question is so specific that nobody who doesn't have to do that particular homework will care about the answer.</p>

<h2>The first rule of rudeness is: don't engage. Flag and move on.</h2>

<p>(The second rule of rudeness is “Jump to rule 1”.)</p>

<hr>

<p>“Asker is rude to people trying to help him” is not an appropriate close reason. The free-form close reasons under “off-topic” are not a place to write random comments — there's the comment facility for that. The free-form close reasons are meant to explain how a question does not fit the site. The prefilled text is “This question appears to be off-topic because it is about ” for a reason: you don't have to include it, but it gives you an idea of the sort of thing you're supposed to write.</p>

<p>Determining whether to close a question is based on the content of the question, not the attitude of the asker. The attitude of the asker may cause you to choose to close and move on rather than spend time editing the question or providing advice in comments — that's fine. But if you can't think of a close reason beyond the asker's attitude, the question doesn't need closing.</p>

<p>Regarding the close reason for homework dumps, “unclear what you're asking” covers several different cases:</p>

<li>there is insufficient information to answer;</li>
<li>the post has clear statements but lacks an actual question.</li>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I disagree with this proposal on the grounds that a new close reason seems unnecessary. Perhaps this isn't a very creative answer, since it's calling for what amounts to the status quo, but hear me out.</p>

<p>First, despite our homework policy (which, granted, may not be visible or intuitive enough for new members), questions which appear to be homework questions (and, let's face it; they probably are homework questions) receive pretty rough treatment around here, or at least that's been my impression over the last few months. I think there's a clear danger in creating a new close reason to make targeting homework questions even easier... it invalidates the spirit of the homework policy and legitimizes closing what are probably nearly acceptable questions.</p>

<p>Second, as has already been pointed out, there are existing close reasons that cover most of the questions that actually deserve to be closed. In particular, I'd estimate that lots of new homework questions could pretty trivially be closed as Duplicate or Unclear. While having a custom close reason isn't entirely without merit, it's not necessarily adding a lot of value... especially when one considers that we should be leaving explanatory messages on <em>all</em> closed questions, and having a custom close reason shouldn't be an excuse to stop doing so.</p>

<p>Third, closing questions isn't the only option for dealing with homework questions. The nature of homework questions is that people who have a solid grasp of the material probably know enough to at least rephrase the question into something passable for this site. Why not change homework dumps like ""Show that X implies Y."" into ""I know that X implies Y, but how do you show this?"" or ""Find W such that Z."" into ""Is there a W such that Z? How do you find it?"" Note that we have plenty of questions that don't show much, if any, work, and which we've left open. Targeting questions by new, presumably novice, members might be off-putting. If the question isn't clear enough for a reword attempt, then it's probably unclear enough to close as such.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>We all agree that questions <em>about</em> homework problems are fine, as per our policy. We have been quite rigorous about <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/594/the-return-of-the-homework-question"">closing questions</a> that are problem <em>dumps</em> -- homework, self-learning or whatever.</p>

<p>The usual process is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Comments of the form ""What have you tried? Where did you get stuck?""</li>
<li>Some close votes, mostly ""unclear"".</li>
<li>Sealing the close with e.g. <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/627/reference-templates-for-common-comments/751#751"">the reference comment</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the sheer volume of such questions I am all for the custom close reason: it allows to communicate effectively with both voters and askers about the reasone for closing. We often see that newcomers only read (and respond to) the bold ""unclear"" which is not helpful.</p>

<p>Here's a candidate wording:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a problem statement, not a question. We expect questions to show some independent (research) effort. Adding such detail and a specific question (e.g. about the wording of the problem or concrete steps an own attempt at solving it) may render the post suitable for the site. See <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/594"">here</a> for a relevant discussion; further advice can be sought in [chat].</p>

So sharing a resource via a question and answer pair would only be appropriate is that resource solves a problem and the answer explains the solution — for example, “how do I prove this theorem?” → “here's a summary of the proof published in &lt;article&gt;: …”</p>

<p>You can post pretty much anything in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/"">chat</a> as long as it's related to the site's topic and generally appropriate¹. Just don't overdo it — chat isn't a place for spamming.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>This answer is tailored to the OP; though ofc many of these points can apply to other people asking these types of questions.</p>

<p>For any question related to a touchy topic, to ward off people's automatic-bad-question-alarms (problems):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>It must be small/simple, most importantly, understandable</b>
<ul>
<li>This is the most important, but possibly the hardest for you to do.</li>
<li>Many of your questions included a lot of unnecessary background information; you had a minor question, but it seemed as if you wanted people to solve the whole problem for you; as if, they should see what you are saying and say ""ahhh, I get it"" and answer ""YOU'VE DISCOVERED IT!!"". Instead of answering the minor question, they attacked the entire background (which was indeed quite faulty). Therefore, since you might have several faulty parts, don't make your questions big; otherwise people will bug-out on the first fault they find (particularly with P vs NP questions, and particularly with long and tedious questions). Which leads us to:</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>If it is a major result, expect that you are WRONG</b>, especially if you <em>know</em> you are approaching (read: diving into) the subject as an amateur! Which leads us to:</li>
<li><b>Take the assured-ness down a few notches.</b> If you know you might be messing up on your ""proofs"", don't be so insistent that you are right, be more tentative.</li>
<li><b>If you use the terminology obviously wrong, it is bad</b>, perhaps you should be asking questions about the terminology, or looking it up on wikipedia, or very likely there are previous questions on our very site explaining the terminology.
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, you had some understanding of the terminology, but were using it obviously wrong. <b>This isn't a language-barrier issue</b>; this is a <em>mathematical language barrier</em>: a requirement when conversing in math, to <b>use the <em>mathematical language</em> exactly correctly</b>. At the very least, don't get mad when people don't like the question because you are using terminology so wrong it is impossible to understand. Which leads us to,</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When framing the question, <b>think about how someone else would read it</b>; think if it is understandable. It is easy to put words out that try to express what you are thinking; it is hard to make those words good input to other peoples minds.</li>
<li>Please, <b>don't edit your question a hundred times, to change the meaning</b>, it ruins all the existing answers and makes the question a moving target; keep in mind, that by the time you are editing your question, it is likely almost no one will re-read it again.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result of the above (solutions):</p>

<ul>
<li>Break the question down into <b>small easily readable parts</b>. It should be one or two small paragraphs; try limiting yourself to, say, two thousand characters. (the limits don't apply universally ofc, I am merely suggesting a limit that will not cause people's eyes to glaze over, even if there are other issues with the question).</li>
<li>Get the question right; <b>look up the terminology, use it correctly</b>.
<ul>
<li><b>Take your time publishing the question</b>; review it several times, think about it from another perspective, and see if it is understandable. Get the math terminology correct (not addressing the language barrier).</li>
<li>If you run into terminology that you do not fully understand, <b>congratulations! You have another question to ask first</b>. Of course see if it was asked already, or answered trivially on the net: <b>The same ideas apply recursively to the new question!</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try to make the question itself non-trivial; you can look up trivial stuff directly on wikipedia or elsewhere.</li>
<li>If it is anything mentioning ""P vs NP"", <b>and claiming a result, <i>you are doing it wrong</i></b>: you should be claiming how your result doesn't make sense, as it would mean a breakthrough, and the question should be to help find the faults. Therefore, always change ""check my proof"" to ""find my error"" (and I don't mean just the tags).</li>
<li><b>Ask the question with humility</b>.</li>
<li>If you edit the question to fix it up, and it changes the meaning of the question too drastically, <b>ask it again</b>. Of course, if the question is bad in other ways aside from your edit, it might just sink again.</li>
</ul>

5,"<p>there is mountains written on the P vs NP problem. its a great/awesome/formidable/worthwhile problem to study. many or even most people working or studying CS have some interest in it. but, many neophytes get interested thinking it might be like other problems they have encountered from their experience. it is deceptive that way. easy to state, very difficult to prove. there are many problems like that in math and computer science. some pros in the field even call them ""diseases"" for this &amp; related reasons.</p>

<p>its of course impossible to read a large part of all that is written on P vs NP. however, there are many good surveys. there are <strong>basics</strong> about the problem that even neophytes should be aware of and can learn without too much trouble. it can be approached. one should realize that many basic questions about P vs NP have already been asked in the literature or in these forums. search for the related questions.</p>

<p>questions do not exist here out of a background context. there are a few experts that ""hang out"" in these forums. they notice who is asking what questions and what their backgrounds are. if you dont follow up on their answers, they will begin to think they are wasting their time answering your questions. this includes <strong>reading</strong> and <strong>familiarizing yourself</strong> with the basics on the problem. actually much of it can be found on <strong>wikipedia</strong>. if you dont read anything outside of what is posted in these forums (esp on an extremely challenging problem of this type), your attitude will be judged as <strong>not serious</strong> and you will only continue to frustrate yourself &amp; others in their interactions with you &amp; the spirit of generosity in cyberspace will only be degraded over time...</p>

<p>""you have to crawl/walk before you can run"" applies in the CS field as in any other field.</p>

<p>for example here are a few basics that one should be able to answer before attempting to work on P vs NP</p>

<ol>
<li><p>what is the page on the internet that lists flawed proofs? have you looked at any on this list? how many are on this list? have you found any errors in them? do you think your talent exceeds those who have written them?</p></li>
<li><p>answer basic questions about big-oh O(n) notation. for example, explain why if it is known that a program runs in O(n^k) time, it is not guaranteed that one can also run it in O(n^(k-1)) time.</p></li>
<li><p>be aware of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%E2%80%93Levin_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">cook-levin</a> proof and be able to describe roughly how it works.</p></li>

5,"<p>I think it has been explained why such posts are not suitable for any SE site.
They are not useful to anyone else:
questions here are not meant just for the author but also should benefit others.
The real intention of such posts is typically not learning anything or 
solving any actual problem the OP is facing but 
the real intention is to receive verification for the OP's claims.
SE sites should not be abused for proof checking people's attempts to solve open problems.</p>

<p>I think <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/18643/3-sat-to-2-sat-reduction/18647#18647"">this post</a> demonstrates why we should not allow such posts.
Not only the OP is incapable of solving P vs. NP and continues to make simple elementary mistakes, 
he is incapable of understanding what is wrong with his arguments even after people tell him. It results in long unnecessary discussions that could have been easily avoided if the OP had read an introduction to complexity theory textbook.</p>

<p>I think the appropriate answer in these situations is not telling the OP what is wrong with the argument but to tell the OP to go read an introduction to complexity theory textbook before trying to solve its most famous problem.
As they say on SO, ""<em>questions must demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved</em>"" which is not the case here.</p>

<p>Fair question, no offense taken. </p>

<p>One of the reasons I asked about it here first is so that we can set a standard for asking for test cases. It might open a new set of questions for the CS:StackExchange site and get more users in here and more different questions; NP and grammar problems are getting boring.</p>

<p>Some of the test I have are  </p>

<pre><code>5-3-1           : is (5-3)-1 and not 5-(3-1) to test left associativity  
2^3^4           : is 2^(3^4) and not (2^3)^4 to test right associativity. 
1               : has no operator to test if that will pass through without error.
-1              : is the simplest test of a prefix unary operator. 
(1)             : is the simplest test with parens and no operators.  
0!              : is the simplest test of a postfix unary operator.
-(3-1)          : the unary - has to be applied as a different operator, 
                  i.e. in postfix notation: 31--.  
(3-1)!          : the expression has to be evaluated before applying the factorial operator.
((4-(3-(2-1)))) : to test the shunting yard.

",CSmeta
5,"<p>As far as I am concerned, the <em>principles</em> of testing are a part of software engineering (here the academic field, not the profession) which is in turn a part of computer science¹. Therefore, questions that asks about <em>principles</em> of testing, e.g.</p>

<li>strategies for random testing,</li>
<li>automatic generation of meaningful test cases,</li>
<li>combinatoric testing,</li>
<li>measures of test quality,</li>

6. The OP has demonstrated the work they have preformed in trying to solve the specific problem so that the answer can teach the OP something. (No homework dumps of just the question and especially no scans of a homework problem as these show no effort by the OP that can be used to help the OP other than giving them the answer).<br>
7. The question can have an answer that can help others learn. (A question that has a simple yes or no answer would not be beneficial.)</p>

<p>I also see that the OP gave a reasoning behind their answer which if not present would possibly get one or more down votes, one or more close votes, and possibly a comment requesting the OP to explain what they have tried or a recommendation on what to try.</p>

5,"<p>I agree with you and Raphael that the first question should not have been closed as ""too basic"", and I think Raphael has provided a perfectly reasonable explanation and response.  Hey, we're all human.</p>

<p>That said, the first question has other.. blemishes and could be improved.  One problem is that the question doesn't give any indication of why the author thinks that ""we can test for regularity using the Myhill–Nerode theorem"".  This is a sign that the author hasn't put in as much effort as he/she could have (he/she should have tried working out the details, and then maybe he/she would have figured out the answer for himself/herself), and it also forces answerers to try to guess what might have been in the author's mind.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Editing the question to improve the question to address any comments it has gotten and any plausible, anticipable misunderstandings and to make it more useful to others.</p></li>

<p>It's not clear to me why it was deleted, the answer is valid in the sense that it attempts to answer the question (whether it's a good answer or not is irrelevant, that's what voting is for). It doesn't contain abuse or advertising.</p>

<p>The answer is of low quality: it states that the answer is yes and cites an example language but does not cite what makes this example work. It is written in an evangelist style, rather than in the explanatory style that I would expect on a site which is about science. It is not necessarily wrong, per se, but it lacks substance that would make it interesting and useful, and its presentation is likely to arouse controversy.</p>

<p>I wouldn't normally delete this answer as a moderator — I would comment and request improvements on the basis given above — because it is not a clear-cut case. However I would vote to delete it as <em>very low quality</em> if I had a non-binding vote.</p>

5,"<p>Because the math can include things like <code>\def</code>, <code>\label</code>, <code>\ref</code>, etc., it turns out to be a more complex process to do incremental updates than you might think.  I did a version of it <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4208/a-prototype-for-incremental-preview-updates"">here</a>, but I don't think it works any more (hooking into the SE editor was fragile, and I think the code has changed since I wrote the userscript, and it no longer is able to hook in properly).</p>

<p>Note that even this approach was not sophisticated enough, as things like bullet lists and such need to be broken down further, so it is not just a matter of breaking into paragraphs (as you suggest, and as I implemented back then).</p>

All of these are legitimate reasons for downvotes. It is doubtful that these votes are related to the ongoing election, especially since they wouldn't influence it in any way. Nonetheless, going through a user's profile and downvoting many of their posts is not appropriate behavior, even if you genuinely think each post deserves a downvote — the only rule about voting is that you must not target a user.

5,"<h3>Tagging</h3>

<p>Tagging is an important feature of Stack Exchange for several reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tags help searching.</li>
<li>Tags are used to select ""Related"" questions for the site bar.</li>
<li>Tags help disambiguate titles in question lists.</li>
<li>Tags allow users to filter what they see.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point is probably the most relevant: experts of an area may not even <em>see</em> a question just because it is badly tagged.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, new users almost always tag their questions badly because they don't know the right keywords and/or are not familiar with the tag space or the platform. We have to help them out.</p>

<p>Everyone who can edit posts can edit tags, too. Here are some guidelines as to what represents good tagging.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Category tags</strong></p>

<p>This is not a feature of the platform, but we have some broad tags that describe roughly where in CS the question lies. Examples are <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/algorithms"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;algorithms&#39;"" rel=""tag"">algorithms</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/complexity-theory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;complexity-theory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">complexity-theory</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/computer-networks"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;computer-networks&#39;"" rel=""tag"">computer-networks</a> and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programming-languages"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;programming-languages&#39;"" rel=""tag"">programming-languages</a>.</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> Every question should have at least one category (or at least frequent) tag.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Classification tags</strong></p>

<p>Once you established the broad category, go into detail. Is your question about <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/algorithm-analysis"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;algorithm-analysis&#39;"" rel=""tag"">algorithm-analysis</a> or <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/search-algorithms"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;search-algorithms&#39;"" rel=""tag"">search-algorithms</a> or both? Are the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/data-structures"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;data-structures&#39;"" rel=""tag"">data-structures</a> at hand <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/search-trees"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;search-trees&#39;"" rel=""tag"">search-trees</a> or <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graphs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graphs&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graphs</a>?</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> Every question should have at least two more specific tags.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New tags</strong></p>

<p>Don't be afraid to create new tags. If they end up being not useful, that is no other questions are tagged similarly, the system will automatically delete the tag. </p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you create an undesired tag or a duplicate, we can delete tags and/or create synonyms so future visitors are more likely to find the appropriate tags.</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> create new tags if you think they may be useful for tagging more questions. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you think older questions should get the new tag (maybe a once specific enough tag needs more specialisation as more questions appear), please raise the issue here on Meta; retagging lots of questions is an invasive step that should not be taken without discussion.</p></li>
</ul>
",CSmeta
5,"<h3>Titles</h3>

<p>Titles are important: they represent the question on the main site, in search results and in RSS feeds. We want users to visit questions (and to answer them) and a good title may make just the difference.</p>

<p>Also, titles fuel the search for related questions in the ""Ask Question"" form. A question titled ""How to analyse this piece of code?"" will never stand out as containing <em>my</em> answer; ""What is the runtime of this nested for-loop?"" just might.</p>

<p>Titles are tough. They have to be expressive enough to tell readers what to expect but short enough to be read at all. Here are some guidelines towards writing better titles.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Level of detail</strong></p>

<p>There needs to be enough of your question in the title so that users should know what to expect. If they are surprised at what they find after clicking through, the title was bad. On the other hand, don't try to put <em>every</em> detail in the title; that's what the main post is there for.</p>

<p>""Improve shortest-path algorithm"" is too generic, ""How can I save $\Theta(n)$ memory while computing shortest paths on ERM-graphs with the variant of Dijkstra given in ""Some book title"" by S. Author?"" is too detailed. A good title would be ""Can Dijkstra use less memory on random graphs?"".</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> Accurately describe your core problem. Don't be overly generic, but also not too detailed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>As short as possible and as long as necessary</strong></p>

<p>The title needs to contain a snappy version of the question, but not a lot of information; that's what the main post is for.</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> Less than half a line is probably too little, more than one line is probably too much.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Choice of words</strong></p>

<p>A good title uses computer science jargon where appropriate. Use ""shortest path"" instead of ""quickest route"" and ""is Turing-complete"" instead of ""can compute everything"".</p>

<p>Don't overdo it, though; if a term has been defined in a paper published three weeks ago, it will not be recognised.</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> Use terms a CS undergrad student would know and use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LaTeX</strong></p>

<p>It is tempting to title your question ""Is $\{ a^k b^{2k} c^m \mid k,m \in \mathbb{N} \} \in \mathrm{CFL}$?"" but that is bad for two reasons: mathematics is hard to search and titles are not rendered by MathJax everywhere, e.g. in RSS readers. Use ""Is this language similar to $a^n b^n$ context-free?""</p>

<p>Note that there is also the possibility of using Unicode, at least for ""flat"" formulae. For instance, instead of</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Is $\Theta(f) = \Omega(f) \cup O(f)$?
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Is $\Theta(f) = \Omega(f) \cup O(f)$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you could use</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Is Θ(f) = Ω(f) ∪ O(f)?
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Is Θ(f) = Ω(f) ∪ O(f)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which you can copy &amp; paste from the rendered output. Make sure to insert some spaces, though.</p>

<p>Combining both forms can be a suitable compromise:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code> Is $Θ(f) = Ω(f) ∪ O(f)$?
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Is $Θ(f) = Ω(f) ∪ O(f)$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> Use as little formulae in titles as possible. Never use more than can be read comfortably without MathJax.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Keep one general guideline in mind: if you have trouble coming up with a good title, you are not ready to post the question yet, or it may be unsuited for the site at all.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<h3>Language</h3>

<p>Language often is a matter of taste and many of us are non-natives. Therefore, we are bound to find ""strange"" language more often than not, but that is no reason to edit everything.</p>

<p>On the other hand, posts need to be comprehensible. Sometimes, bad translations, inventive grammar and peculiar terms stand in the way of understanding a post.</p>

<ul>
<li>Edit titles to be clear and correct. Titles are the business cards of questions and we want those to shine.</li>
<li>Edit posts only to a level of easy understanding.</li>
<li><p>Edit posts that use acronyms to introduce the long forms, too. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By performing BFS on the NFA we can find whether it accepts any word. Does DFS work, too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>should become</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By performing breadth-first search (BFS) on the finite automaton (NFA) we can find whether it accepts any word. Does depth-first search (DFS) work, too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The acronyms can be dropped if they are not needed in the rest of the post.</p>

<p>This does not only improve readability for non-experts (many acronyms are heavily overloaded across fields!) but also makes content easier to search for.</p></li>
<li>Never edit for style.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use good judgement! Help users that try their best. If somebody clearly spent less time on writing their post than you reading it, just downvote or close vote (if it is not comprehensible).</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>This seems to be a common issue in various less thoroughly tested parts of the Stack Exchange code base.  For example, it also happens in the 10k flag review for any posts hidden behing the ""show already flagged posts"" link.</p>

<p>The fundamental cause of this bug is a combination of the following issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the duplicate tabs (and various other hidden-by-default parts of the SE user interface) are initially loaded, they're marked as hidden by giving them the class <code>dno</code>, which is styled in the site CSS as:</p>

<pre><code>.dno { display: none }
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>On Stack Exchange sites that use MathJax, the TeX preprocessor is explicitly configured not to look for math inside any elements with the <code>dno</code> class, presumably as a performance optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>In various parts of the Stack Exchange code that deal with toggling item visibility, the showing of previously hidden items is often done simply by calling the jQuery <code>.show()</code> method.  This method adds an explicit <code>display: block</code> style to the element that <em>overrides</em> the <code>display: none</code> rule for the <code>dno</code> class.  However, it does <em>not</em> actually remove the class from the element, nor does it tell MathJax that the element would need to be re-typeset.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The proper way to fix this would, arguably, be for the Stack Exchange UI code to define its own ""show a hidden element"" method that was aware of these issues, and then systematically use that method instead of the plain jQuery <code>.show()</code> method.</p>

<p>In the mean time, however, an alternative fix is to modify the jQuery <code>.show()</code> method itself to remove the <code>dno</code> class and queue a MathJax typeset pass, like this:</p>

<pre><code>var oldShow = $.fn.show;
$.fn.show = function () {
    this.filter('.dno').hide().removeClass('dno').each( function () {
        typeof(MathJax) !== 'undefined' &amp;&amp;
            MathJax.Hub.Queue(['Typeset', MathJax.Hub, this]);
    } );
    return oldShow.apply(this, arguments);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Conveniently, this fix can also be implemented as a <a href=""https://stackapps.com/tags/script/info"">user script</a> without changing any of the Stack Exchange code.  I've included this fix in version 1.6 of the <a href=""https://stackapps.com/questions/4486/stack-overflow-unofficial-patch""><strong>Stack Overflow Unofficial Patch</strong></a>, a collection of client-side CSS and JavaScript fixes for the Stack Exchange network.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>there are some answer(s) here looking at more pragmatic angles on this topic eg how CS contrasts vs software engineering or programming &amp; plays out post-graduation eg in the employment market. have worked in IT for many yrs and would suggest this is a complex question with quite a bit of nuance and no simple answers/distinctions even though it is a key question of interest to pre-university students attempting to make an informed decision about choice of major and future directions. </p>

<p>the analogy to building construction is somewhat useful. industry generally has two common roles: lead developer and developer. the latter is sometimes called a software engineer in more professional organizations, or simply a programmer. industry does sometimes have a ""software architect"" role who may or may not be involved in developing, their role is more to focus on ""big picture"" aspects of large systems [such as defining/streamlining inter-system interfaces, somewhat analogous to generating construction design ""blueprints""], and this <em>dedicated</em> role is not so common except in large corporations; midsize-to-smaller corporations may have individuals that fill aspects of this role but are not fully dedicated to it (eg also do major development). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Booch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grady Booch</a> is an example of an expert figure who has great insight into more accurately/precisely delineating the software architect role.</p>

<p>furthermore at my university [which is presumably somewhat representative], software engineering is a branch of the engineering school and the student must take many engineering classes [which often have more depth in mathematics and physical science–eg physics, statics/dynamics, chemistry, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics!–than required of CS degrees] and specialize in software in their later grades. in other words the student is trained and certified as an engineer [there are certification societies] with a speciality in software.</p>

<p>post-university however these background distinctions may tend to blur in some corporations as it would be somewhat rare that both software engineers or computer scientists actually utilize all the diverse pedagogical/theoretical/scientific/engineering/mathematical aspects of their university education on particular jobs esp ""entry level""–although over an entire <em>career</em> of course much more will come into play.</p>

<p>one approach to answering this question: <em>look up the course descriptions or curricula/requirements for CS vs software engineering majors at a school that offers both or across schools.</em></p>

5,"<h3>Formatting</h3>

<p><strong>Markdown</strong></p>

<p>Use the basic formatting provided by Markdown to structure posts: lists should be Markdown lists (nesting works!), links should use the <code>[text](URL)</code> syntax, emphasis should be placed by <code>*...*</code>, citations put in <code>&gt; ...</code> paragraphs and source code in code blocks (prepend lines with four spaces). There is <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/editing-help"">extensive documentation</a> of what is possible; use it wisely.</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> Edit for clarity. Prettify links and introduce structure. Remove long emphases (and almost all bolding).</p>

<p><strong>LaTeX</strong></p>

<p>When mathematics are involved, the best option is typically (<a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/981/98"">not always</a>) to use LaTeX. New users often don't know that we have MathJax and use code environments or something else to typeset their formulae. In these cases, we should help them along by translating their mathematics to LaTeX (and post <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/818/98"">a comment</a> so they know). See also <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271/add-short-reference-for-latex-commands"">this quick guide</a>.</p>

<p>Existing LaTeX may have to be fixed to use standard notation or just to improve readability. Examples are to use <code>\mid</code> instead of <code>|</code> in grammars and sets, set longer formulae apart (and maybe <code>\displaystyle</code> them) or using <code>align</code>-environments for alignment.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to edit away Unicode maths as long as notation is consistent.</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> Edit mathematics for clarity.</p>

<p><strong>Images</strong></p>

<p>Images are often a good way of illustrating a point. However, images should be</p>

<ul>
<li>accompanied by credit to the source (if applicable),</li>
<li>not be overly large and</li>
<li>easy to ""read"".</li>
</ul>

<p>Every editor can e.g. trim away the desk in a photograph of a graph drawn on paper (just reupload the trimmed version). If you are particularly motivated (and want to improve your TikZ skills) you can recreate photos, but that's not to be expected.</p>

<p>In many cases, the only think to do (in appropriate time) is to comment and ask the user to make the changes themselves, especially regarding credit.</p>

<p>One thing to shoot down without mercy are screenshots of problems: everything that is text should be copied in the question (or answer) text so that it can be searched, edited and screen-read.</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> Fix what you can and delegate the rest to the user. Flag if the problems are significant (e.g. question consists <em>only</em> of images).</p>

<p>Did you know about Meta Stack Overflow? Have you ever used it? What do you think of it? What do you think of the split?</p>

<p>Please reply to this informal poll by upvoting the answer that best matches your opinion. If one of the answers almost but not exactly echoes your thoughts, please add or upvote a comment. If none of the answers express your opinion, please write an answer to tell us what you think.</p>

<p>Nearly every feature has been proposed before (but these posts can be hard to find) and repostings are usually immediately closed as duplicate. The fact that situations, requirements and policies change (in particular from the Time Before SE 2.0 to now) is often ignored.</p>

5,"<p>We all love <a href=""http://cs.stackexchange.com"">Computer Science Stack Exchange</a>, but there is a whole world of people out there who need answers to their questions and don't even know that this site exists. When they arrive from Google, what will their first impression be? Let's try to look at this site through the eyes of someone who's never seen it before, and see how we stack up against the rest of the 'Net.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/review/site-eval"">Site Self-Evaluation review queue</a> is open and populated with 10 questions that were asked and answered in the last quarter. 
Run a few Google searches to see how easy they are to find and compare the answers we have with the information available on other sites.</p>

<p>Rating the questions is only a part of the puzzle, though. Do you see a pattern of questions that should have been closed but are not? Questions or answers that could use an edit? Anything that's going really well? <strong>Post an answer below to share your thoughts</strong> and discuss these questions and the site's health with your fellow users!</p>

I just noticed that both had vanished and was wondering why. Is this perhaps a bug or is there another explanation? It's not that I particularly care about a disappeared comment, but I've never seen this behavior before. (If there was a way to put a question mark after a tag, I'd have done so.) </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>In the words of the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment"">official guidance</a>, “comments are temporary ""Post-It"" notes left on a question or answer”.</p>

<p>In practice, a lot of comments stay around indefinitely. However, when a comment has outlived its usefulness, it is ideally deleted. You can vote to delete an obsolete comment by flagging it as “obsolete”. To flag a comment, click on the flag-shaped icon that appears at the left of the comment when hovering over it. A popup will appear and you will be able to select a reason to delete the comment. Besides obsolescence, reasons to flag a comment include rudeness and irrelevance to the post that they are on.</p>

<p>Comments are automatically removed if they receive sufficient flags in a certain time period. This hardly happens on this site; comment flags are also seen by moderators who will delete the comment if they agree with the flag. Comments can also be erased by their author.</p>

<p>In this case, your comment was intended to another user, and was not generally useful to other users. After this user had read your comment, it no longer served as a useful purpose. Your comment was flagged, and removed by a moderator.</p>

But that question was marked (rightly so) as duplicate on November 28, 2013 (3 months ago, so there isn't the excuse that it was selected before being deemed duplicate). If we want to weed out duplicate/redundant questions, this shouldn't happen. I often look up the related questions, and sometimes had comments or supplementary answers for them, which are closed for duplicates AFAIU.</p>

<p>Or is there a rationale for this I don't see? </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>fyi. the two sites are neck-and-neck but as of now an inflection point has been reached and cs.se is pulling out in front in total # of questions. cs.se as of this second has 5412 questions; tcs.se has 5402 questions. this is quite notable also given that cs.se has a significantly younger age. obviously, the saying ""quality over quantity"" is applicable, &amp; # of questions is only one dimension of the site, albeit a crucial one that correlates with overall participation/ engagement/ health etc.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>Is there an upper limit to how often users may ask a question? I am doing masters level research so my questions are not ""homework dumps"" or anything that I haven't already searched for extensively, banged my head against a wall thinking about, etc. I try to be sufficiently specific that I don't get more direction than I really need, but if I'm having a good week there may be a domino effect of fruitful interaction here, progress on my part and more bite-sized questions. I just want to use this resource appropriately.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The only technical limit is that you must wait 20 minutes between questions (this only applies to low-reputation users). A few of the biggest site in the Stack Exchange network have additional limits: a maximum of 6 questions per day and 50 per rolling month, but these limits do not apply here. (Source: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/164899/the-complete-rate-limiting-guide"">The Complete Rate-Limiting Guide</a>)</p>

<p>There isn't a number that I'd put forward as a limit, etiquette wise. If you find yourself asking 50 questions a month, you should probably rethink your participation — but even that is highly dependent on the quality of your questions.</p>

<p>The important thing is that you <strong>ask good questions</strong>. As long as you do, I expect that nobody will mind, or indeed care. If you're imposing on us, we'll let you know progressively, via comments asking you to improve your questions. Only a pattern of asking low-quality questions would be abusive, and then the problem would be the quality well before volume became a concern.</p>

<p>As a masters student, there are undergraduate-level questions that you should be able to answer. I encourage you to spend a bit of time answering as well: it's a great way to organize your thoughts about things you already know, and a mini-practice for when you'll be writing up your research or doing some teaching. But this is only a personal encouragement for your own sake, it's perfectly fine to participate here only by asking questions.</p>

5,"<p>When I was a student not too long ago I posted all of my questions on SO, so Im just wondering how this site is suppose to be different? What should I post here instead of on SO?

",CSmeta
5,"<p>A question¹ that has been around for some time was recently closed as duplicate² by moderator overrule.</p>

<p>I don't agree with this closure for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's not a duplicate of the question provided²: it asks for the analysis
of a nested loop, not about particularities of Landau notation. The OP 
<em>does</em> end up making the ""sum of Landau terms""-mistake -- but incidentally.</p></li>
<li><p>Leaving duplicate aside, this is not a dump question since the OP does
provide an attempt. The reasoning is succinct enough so that the question
""Is my reasoning correct?"" is a focussed enough question.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the elaborate and well-written answers, <em>this</em> is a question I'd like
to use as target for duplicate closures of other ""nested loop runtime"" 
questions.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Since we <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/14564222#14564222"">did not find consens among the moderators</a> (the majority being biased by having provided answers to the question¹) and multiple users have voted to ""Leave Closed"", I'm posing this question here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should the question remain closed? Why?</li>
<li>If so, should we change the linked duplicate?</li>
</ul>

<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/366/what-goes-wrong-with-sums-of-landau-terms"">What goes wrong with sums of Landau terms?</a></li>
</ol>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>As I see it, there are several possible views of the question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The actual question asked is ""Is my analysis correct?"" (This is even more obvious in the original version of the question.) As I understand the <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/597/"">previous</a> <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/519"">discussions</a>, these questions are considered close-worthy most of the time.</p></li>
<li><p>It happens to be the case that the answer to 1. is ""No"", making an actual SE-worthy question of ""What is wrong?"" resp. ""Why is this wrong?"" This question is what Gilles answered. It also is a duplicate of the linked question.</p></li>
<li><p>If we ignore the failed attempt of the OP, we arrive at the question that you and Subhayan answered. However, without that attempt, the question is merely a problem dump.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Conclusion: As the question stands, it is not clear if 2. or 3. is the actual question. So the question should be closed as ""unclear what you're asking"". If it is changed to be clearly 2. (or 3.), it should be closed as a duplicate (resp. a problem dump).</p>

<p>Option:</p>

<p>Remove the answer attempt by the OP (or turn it into an answer), ignore the fact that it is a problem dump and either adapt Gilles' answer to fit question 3. or move it to the duplicate (this will probably require some adapting as well).</p>

<ol>
<li>Google Trend is probably poor at detecting trends within the scientific community. </li>

<p>In conclusion, I don't think you have a ""real"" problem at your hands; and even if you did, you'd be unlikely to get a factual, objective answer.

<li><p>The real question that I think you have is if the field is bogus or not. That is not good question either. From time to time fields get hyped and then suddenly people learn the reality doesn't match the claims and the hype collapses and then you get reactions to the hype. Asking if it is bogus or fraud about a field is not a good question, it doesn't make much sense. If you want to learn about a particular result in a field ask about it. If you want to know if it worth to work in a particular field then that is primary pinion based, if you want to know if it worth to do research and learn about the field or peruse a carrier in it then again that is primarily opinion based.

<p>Now what would be a similar better question? You can ask what are the major contributions of the field. You can ask for interesting applications of the field. You can ask for a description of the field and its goals. These <em>might be</em> OK.

<p>This is a question of programming concept. By utilizing the simulation of Japanese Multiplication, <strong>is my program actually capable of improving calculation speed? Or am I doomed from the start?</strong></p>

<p>Maybe I'm asking this in a way that doesn't fully make sense out of ignorance with the topic. Any tips on the right question to ask, or the right way to ask it would be helpful. I'm savvy with computers, but not at all with hardware engineering, and I'd like to learn to interpret diagrams like this so that I can better educate myself on the ALU and similar components. </p>

<p><em>Here's the question that I'd like to ask:</em></p>

<h2>How do I interpret this diagram of and adder-subtractor?</h2>

<p>Stepping foot past the realm of software, out of want for an understanding of the advanced fundamentals of hardware, I've found myself looking at a diagram of an adder-subtractor that I don't know how to interpret. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WfSf7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This is a supporting diagram in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder%E2%80%93subtractor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia's documentation on an adder-subtractor</a>, accompanied by the description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A 4-bit ripple-carry adder–subtractor based on a 4-bit adder that
  performs one's complement on A when D=1 to yield S=B-A</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to begin educating myself on bare-bones hardware structure and logic at this level, however I do this out of interest in obtaining a fuller understanding as a software engineer, but not in becoming an actual hardware engineer.</p>

<p>So, without taking on a hardware engineer's reading list, I'd like to know in the least possible detail (simplest way):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is this representing exactly, in terms of hardware? Am I seeing the pathway of electric current through a chip on a logic board? Exactly what physical components are represented in this diagram?</p></li>
<li><p>I assume the arrows represent a current. I also notice that there are some green arrows connected to small dots, as well as some orange pieces with a 1 &amp; 0, and blue pieces labeled ""1-bit Full Adder"". What do each of these four components of the diagram mean?</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I see that the arrow's path seems to start at D. What does D represent? Are the next arrow points simply paths that a current can take to complete the operation? </p></li>

But I'm not sure if that distinction is really meaningful, and in order to justify distinct tags, the difference in meaning has to be made clear to all.</p>

<p>If they're synonyms, which name should be the main tag? They have about as many uses at the moment.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The nuance may have more to do with grammar.  <code>Parser</code> is a noun.  <code>Parsing</code> is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gerund</a> (a way in english of turning a verb into either a noun or an adjective.)  Parsing is the action that a parser does. We haven't been completely consistent in our choices, but we seem to use gerunds only when the real noun sounds stupid/unnatural.  In this case the real noun doesn't sound stupid, so I vote we go with <code>parser</code>.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>optimization</code> (not <code>optimizing</code>)</li>
<li><code>compilers</code> (not <code>compiling</code>)</li>
<li><code>computer-networks</code> (not <code>computer-networking</code>)</li>
<li><code>search-algorithms</code>, <code>search-trees</code>, <code>search-problem</code> (not <code>searching</code> or <code>searching-*</code>)</li>
<li><code>runtime-analysis</code> (not <code>runtime-analyzing</code> or <code>analyzing-runtime</code>)</li>
<li><code>proof-techniques</code> (not <code>proving</code>)</li>
<li><code>graph-theory</code> (not <code>graph-theorizing</code>)</li>
<li><code>reductions</code> (not <code>reducing</code>)</li>
<li><code>cpu-cache</code> (not <code>caching</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>But</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sorting</code> (not <code>sort-algorithms</code>, <code>sort-problem</code>)</li>
<li><code>machine-learning</code> (not <code>machine-learner</code> or <code>machine-knowledge</code>)</li>
<li><code>dynamic-programming</code> (not <code>dynamic-programs</code>)</li>
<li><code>functional-programming</code> (not <code>functional-program</code>)</li>
<li><code>parallel-computing</code> (not <code>parallel-computer</code>)</li>
<li><code>image-processing</code> (not <code>image-process</code>)</li>
<li><code>natural-language-processing</code> (not <code>natural-language</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>So <code>learning</code>, <code>programming</code> and <code>processing</code> are the main places we use gerunds.</p>

5,"<p>The Stack Exchange team is in the final stages of evaluating a subject for a proposed Stack Exchange site. I'd like to get your feedback and thoughts on this proposal:</p>

<p><a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/55360?phase=definition""><strong>Area 51 Site Proposal &mdash; Operating Systems</strong></a></p>

<p>I'm not generally opposed to creating a more-specialized site when it would attract a new audience whose subject is simply spread across too many sites to attract a comprehensive audience. But I wasn't sure if ""Operating Systems"" fits that criteria. </p>

<p>If you can look past the first dozen-or-so <em>""best choices to write an OS""</em> questions, are the subjects being discussed generally on topic for <em>this</em> community? </p>

<p>We don't have to nit pick specific questions. Even if there is a <em>*bit*</em> of an overlap, we are generally looking at the broader <em>scope</em> of the site as a whole. Basically, we are trying to determine if this proposal will attract a new community, or are we just duplicating or splitting of pieces of this (or other) sites.</p>

<p>So between CS and CSTheory (and Stack Overflow for those low-level systems questions), does this proposal add anything to the subject space of Stack Exchange? Or would you consider the subjects being discussed a welcomed part of <em>this</em> site?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I am deeply ambivalent.  I love cs.se, but we haven't been able to attract the critical mass of OS experts required to make a vibrant community, and we only rarely get good OS questions.  (Look at the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/operating-systems"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;operating-systems&#39;"" rel=""tag"">operating-systems</a> tag, of the 17 questions with a score of 5 or above, 16 were asked in 2012, and the one that was asked in 2013 is closed as off-topic.)</p>

<p>Every question that would be appropriate for the proposed os.se would be on-topic for one (or more) of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://cs.stackexchange.com"">computer science stack exchange</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"">stack overflow</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/"">unix &amp; linux</a></li>
<li>or maybe <a href=""http://superuser.com"">superuser</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>But...</em></strong></p>

<p>There is no critical mass <em>community</em> of operating systems experts on <em>any</em> of those four sites.  Partly this is because any specific OS question is likely to be <em>off</em> topic for at least one of those sites.  Questions that include code or about the internals of a specific OS, would be unwelcome here.  Questions about kernel internals would probably be off-topic in SU.  Questions about OS in general, or about non-unixes (e.g., Windows, OSX, BeOS, VMS, z/OS, VxWorks, AmigaOS, ...) would be off-topic in U&amp;L.</p>

<p>SO probably has the appropriate critical mass, but there the good OS questions get lost in the noise, good questions about OS and distributed system <em>theory</em> will probably get closed as off topic, and, well, SO is so large and diverse that it is difficult for <em>any</em> subcommunity to form and grow there.  SO doesn't provide the technical facilities required to build a smaller subcommunity (e.g., portals for specific groups of tags, each with their own user rankings, moderators, community review-queues, chatrooms, meta, and norms about what makes a good/bad question.) SE doesn't provide the technical facilities required to allow a subcommunity to work across different sites (no cross posting or tag sharing.) The only option for building such a community is to propose a completely separate new site on Area51.</p>

Clearly there is demand for building cross communities that isn't being met in any other way than through Area 51 proposals.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>I wish that cs.se could attract all the OS experts that are committing to the Area 51 OS proposal.  (But we haven't).  I wish that SE would acknowledge the need to allow cross posting and/or other ways of growing subcommunities.  (But they won't).  So a few weeks ago I sadly committed to the Area 51 OS proposal and, should it go to Beta, will make every effort to help it succeed.</p>

<p>Summary of the summary: I'm ambivalent.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>My motivation behind proposing this website started prior to taking an operating systems course. I noticed there people did in fact talk about multithreading, semaphores and other OS-related questions, which was great. However, when I started taking the course and ran into specific questions, it wasn't as convenient as asking programming related questions on SO, or electronics related questions on EE.SE. Instead i'd always debate whether I should ask on SO, or CS.SE, or SU.SE. Just like I've been debating recently whether I should post this machine learning and computer vision algorithm questions on SO.SE or Stats.SE or DSP.SE. I'd either get an answer back when it's too late, or just have it unanswered. </p>

<p>Here's <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/14780/is-an-event-counter-essentially-an-integer-version-of-barrier?noredirect=1#comment50021_14780"">one example</a> of a question I asked over half a year ago. </p>

<p>In later part of the same class, we were suppose to implement a distributed system along a set of computers on a network using an algorithm like Lamport or Maekawa's for synchronization. This was more troubling in the sense of implementing as oppose to dealing with concepts. </p>

<p>The motivation didn't come from setting up page for the mass OS users/developers, but mostly for making it more accessible to the OS experts, when these OS users/developers need help. That way they don't have to jump on several sites and search for OS related problems to solve.</p>

<p>I believe it's worth giving it shot to see how the beta would go. Real world and industrial problems do exist, and people and students could use assistance in these fields. Hoping experts will be equally motivated as they are in SO, SE.EE and other active websites. </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Background: I'm a former computer scientist (not in an OS-related field), current developer working on an in-house OS, and I've been around Stack Exchange quite a bit (including being a moderator of the Computer Science SE site).</p>

<p><strong>I do not feel any need for an Operating Systems site</strong>. When it comes to OS design, engineering questions go on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a>, and scientific questions go on <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/"">Computer Science</a>. Most questions are clearly on one side of the fence, and for those that are borderline, a site can be picked.</p>

<p>There's a whole continuum of questions that are related to OSes to various degrees: security, concurrency, debugging, linking, device drivers, memory management, … All of these topics could go on either the OS site, or the existing programming and CS sites.</p>

<p>This is in contrast with other topics for which I do feel a need for a separate site, such as cryptography (because it overlaps between computer science, math, programming and security engineering) or machine learning (computer science, programming, statistics) or embedded systems (programming, electronics, and what for want of a better word I'll call embedded system administration). In these cases, it's not just the discipline that overlaps but very often individual questions.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/55360/operating-systems?phase=definition"">example questions on Area 51</a>, I see:</p>

<ul>
<li>a majority of programming questions would work on SO;</li>
<li>a few more theoretical questions which would work on CS;</li>
<li>a couple of questions that are about existing OSes (always Unix variants), which I suspect would be off-topic on OS.SE, e.g. “What gives better performace for syslog, logging through sockets or kernel calls?”, or “Why does /proc/kcore on Linux show as having such a huge size? How does it actually exist on disk?” which a comment states is intended to be off-topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>OS.SE wouldn't drive traffic away from SO, it's just a drop in the ocean and I'd expect most people who are active on SO and knowledgeable about the topic to keep not noticing the existence of other SE sites.</p>

<p>OS.SE might drive potential traffic away from CS.SE. CS.SE is doing well on theoretic topics (unsurprisingly, given that a significant part of the founding community came via <a href=""http://cstheory.stackexchange.com"">Theoretical Computer Science SE</a>), but lacking on most applied topics. I don't think OS.SE would attract many researchers in OS-related fields, however: if the site launches, considering the example questions and the cross-site participation of the committers, I expect it to be populated mostly by professional developers and hobbyists. Nonetheless, if OS.SE does make it through, it will be hindrance for CS.SE to grow in the direction of applied topics in the OS domain.</p>

<p>I committed to the OS proposal because if it exists, it interests me. However I think that the best course of action would be to close that proposal as a duplicate of primarily SO and secondarily CS.SE.</p>

<p>Rather than attempt to build a new community, we should spend effort fostering the existing community of CS.SE. <strong>If you're interested in the theory of operating systems, please join us!</strong>. Start <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=operating-systems"">asking questions</a> and browse our <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/operating-systems"">existing questions</a> (but a word of warning, these are mostly undergraduate-level).</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think Wandering Logic brought up several interesting points that should to be studied and discussed independent of this discussion. E.g. it might worth creating and experimenting with a view of questions on SO and CS.SE that gives the feeling of an individual site (way more than tag-sets), where posted questions are posted automatically (based on content analysis and used tags) to SO or CS.SE, displayed reputation is based on posts having OS tag, etc. </p>

<p>Now going back to the topic of this discussion:</p>

<p>I am for using the existing sites as much as possible, so normally I would be opposed to another CS site. 
However, it has been over a year now and it looks like that there is an agreement that we  haven't attracted the necessary group of OS experts for a healthy OS Q&amp;A. 
I think we all can agree that bring in OS experts is a good thing. If CS.SE can do it, very nice, if not and OS.SE can do so, it is still nice. </p>

<p>The danger is that OS.SE will not build such a community for OS and will not bring in new OS researchers but will become a location for moving OS questions from various existing sites. A good test might be checking once by one the people who have committed to OS.SE who are OS experts. If the proposal is not lead by OS experts by others then there is a good chance that it will be the later case not the former one. It would not be a good thing. If the proposal is lead by OS experts then it has a chance of attracting more OS experts. </p>

<p>My suggestion would be to
give CS.SE say 3 more months to see if it can reach the required mass for a healthy OS Q&amp;A. If it fails, then I think it is reasonable to try other ways of building a community for OS. OS.SE can be one. So give it a chance to build an OS community within a limited time frame (say 6 months or 1 year). State it clearly that the site needs to attract significant number of new OS experts, not just be a place for existing SE users to put their OS questions. If it fails, then they cannot complain about its closure. The questions can be migrated to suitable existing sites. The benefit in this case can be attracting some new OS experts to these existing sites.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I'm going to go ahead and throw my hat into this discussion, as an avid SO user and a supporter of the OS.SE proposal.</p>

<p>First of all, I've been a programmer for a pretty long time. I know my way around most languages and paradigms, and I've worked professionally in several different contexts. That being said, I (like <em>many</em> people in the software development field) have virtually no formal training when it comes to what would be considered undergraduate-level computer science topics.</p>

<p>The net effect of this is that, to me, <strong>CS.SE looks scary</strong> and <strong>CSTheory.SE is basically unintelligible.</strong> If I was someone who came to either of those sites cold and looked through a few pages worth of questions, I would deduce that neither of these sites would be the right place to post an OS development question.</p>

<p>With that being said, the remaining SE site on which to post such a question would obviously be SO...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...but there the good OS questions get lost in the noise, good questions about OS and distributed system theory will probably get closed as off topic, and, well, SO is so large and diverse that it is difficult for any subcommunity to form and grow there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wandering Logic hit the nail on the head on that one.</p>

<p>SO is a great community if you're writing a .NET, Java, C++, Python, or web app. It's a great community when you're working with preexisting frameworks, protocols, and formats. It's even a great community when you're trying to do something unique by branching off of the already-known components. The problem is that SO attracts few subject matter experts on topics that aren't the most popular amongst the software development community&mdash;which is okay, because there's often an equally low number of people using the more rare languages and frameworks, and those people tend to gravitate toward each other and subject-matter specific sites for such questions because the ""critical mass"" isn't there to serve them on SO. <em>That</em> is the gap between SO and the proposed OS.SE.</p>

<p>What I see as the next most important question becomes ""can we build a community of OS developers around a new site?""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The danger is that OS.SE will not build such a community for OS and will not bring in new OS researchers but will become a location for moving OS questions from various existing sites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but first consider that OS developers <strong>already comprise a community that exists today.</strong> I cite the consistent edit activity on <a href=""http://wiki.osdev.org/Special%3aRecentChanges"" rel=""nofollow"">OSDev's wiki</a>, consistent discussion activity on <a href=""http://forum.osdev.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">OSDev's forums</a>, and a <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/osdev/"" rel=""nofollow"">subreddit with a decent number of followers</a> for such a niche area. The reason the wiki and the forums are so active is that they're comprised of a group of people that are doing more or less the same things over and over again&mdash;which is why Stack Overflow became such a success among programmers.</p>

<p>The question in my mind is not whether OS.SE can build a community from the ground up, it's whether we can attract the community that already exists and help it grow further. <em>I believe it can.</em> We just have to bootstrap and market it correctly.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Having nothing better to do, I browsed the unanswered questions. I know that last year there was an effort to clear as many of these as possible, but of course there are still quite a few of them. Digging around further, I also found that even moderators aren't able to migrate questions over 60 days old. Some of our unanswered questions, though, are that old and (to me at least) are crying out to be migrated to, say, math.SE, tcs.SE, or, generally, <em>someOtherMoreAppropriateSite</em>.SE. Does anybody know or can guess the reason behind the ""no migration after 60 days"" rule?</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>Someone just <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/27510/theory-of-computation"">asked a question on the main site requesting a good introductory text for ""Theory of Computation""</a>, which I'm guessing is going to get closed as ""Primarily Opinion Based"".</p>

<p>I agree that such a question is ""primarily opinion based,"" but is likely to be a useful resource for the kinds of people that often ask questions here, and likely to be good ""search bait"".  Additionaly a quick search on ""book"" shows that we have several <em>open</em> questions about book recommendations for algorithm design and/or analysis.</p>

<p><strong><em>Can we create a reference question for book recommendations?</em></strong>  (Or several reference questions, one for each sub-topic, kind of like those pointed to by the meta post <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/599/reference-answers-to-frequently-asked-questions"">Reference answers to frequently asked questions</a>).</p>

<p>I realize (through searching meta) that <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303/what-is-a-good-reference-request"">there is a general dislike for broad reference requests</a>, but I think there is a good argument for making an exception for this case.</p>

<p>Yes, this is the usual fate of book lists on Stack Exchange. The medium is not conducive to this kind of content.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can we create a reference question for book recommendations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't follow: having established that they don't work, let's go and do it?</p>

<p>You speak of making an exception — but why?</p>

<hr>

<p>I can see one way in which book recommendations can work: when rather than calling for one book per answer (which ends up as a jumble of duplicates, irrelevancies and incoherencies), a question calls for a <strong>curriculum</strong>. This means that each answer should:</p>

<ul>
<li>list as many books as are necessary to cover the subject;</li>
<li>omit books that are redundant, or posits them as alternatives;</li>
<li>explain how each book fits in the context of teaching a course or learning by one's self.</li>
</ul>

<p>This also means that we as a community must police such answers, and in particular ensure that “maybe try this one book it's great” answers are deleted.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/9413/algorithm-books-on-a-range-of-topics"">Algorithm books on a range of topics</a> is a variation of this — “given my budget, what books should I buy for my library?”. It similarly calls for answers that spend the whole budget, as opposed to single-item answers. Even there many answerers just added their items as separate answers; only one answerer really tried.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/21684/books-to-prepare-before-reading-knuths-the-art-of-computer-programming-taocp"">Books to prepare before reading Knuth&#39;s The Art Of Computer Programming (TAOCP)</a> is a bit different: it has a precise goal in mind. As it happens, the correct answer to that question happens to list 0 books.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10042/book-to-learn-algorithm-complexity"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10042/book-to-learn-algorithm-complexity</a> I've just closed, neither the question nor the answer seem salvageable.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2495/book-for-algorithms-beyond-cormen"">Book for algorithms beyond Cormen</a> is icky. It's very open-ended and has mediocre but not catastrophic answers, I've left it open for now.</p>

<p>I've edited <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/27510/theory-of-computation"">Theory of computation introductory curriculum</a> in this vein. Of the two already-posted answers, one asserts that one book is enough for a course, so I've left it alone; the other was just making conversation and I've deleted it.</p>

5,"<p>I find the ""Unanswered"" tab and the ""no answers"" filter to be rather confusing.  Do I understand correctly that the ""Unanswered"" tab simply refers to questions that may have answers but not a <em>solution</em> accepted by the poster?  If so, can they not be renamed ""Unsolved""?</p>

5,"<p><em>Caches</em> appears at many different levels or places in computer system. You can have on-chip caches, sytem caches and network caches.

It so happens that we have many questions on that topic, mostly about CPU/memory architecture and about algorithm design.</p>

<p>The tag is definitely not too restrictive — if anything, it's overloaded, as the relevance of CPU caches to algorithm speed and the architecture of memory subsystems are very different topics.

<p>I would actually like to post the bounties on the CSTheory site but I have no significant history there as I do here and I know most of the people who respond here also are on CSTheory.</p>

<p>While I would like the sharing of rep points between sites to be unconstrained, I would settle for a constraint of similar tags. i.e. if more than one site has a similar tag, then one can ask the question on another site with a similar tag and use rep points from a different site for the bounty in the other site.</p>

<p>So the question (discussion) is, should the rep points for a bounty be allowed to be taken from user's rep points of a different Stack Exchange site?</p>

5,"<p>Often times when questions are closed as duplicate, they are simply stated as such and no other information is given. Why is there no procedure for linking to the question that has been duplicated when closing based on duplication. Often times the other question uses different nomenclature to ask the same question that may not be known to the person asking. I understand that the person asking should search first, however if they do not recognize the alternate wording of the other question then they will not see it as a viable answer, and simply marking the new question as duplicate without linking to the old helps no one to actually get the answer they are looking for.</p>

<p>As far as I know, it is not even possible to close as duplicate without giving a link to a question on the site (which is sometimes troublesome, e.g. if duplicates are on other SE sites, Wikipedia or another canonical source).</p>

5,"<p>I've been involved in a comment thread (with babou, not that it makes any difference) that has no reason for existence after both of us have run out of things to say. While it existed it was useful (and it wasn't extended enough to be worth moving to chat), but tomorrow it will just clutter up the site. What I wanted to do was to flag the thread for removal, but I thought it would be impolite to flag a comment that wasn't mine. Surely the mods might appreciate a heads-up on our thread, since I can't imagine that their responsibility extends to reading every comment on this site.</p>

<p><strong>So</strong>, is there a reason behind the policy that you can't flag your own comments? On a more abstract level, is this question worth anything beyond a (tempest-in-a-teapot) tag? </p>

5,"<p>You can always delete your own comments outright and flag the others as ""obsolete"".</p>

5,"<p>Moderators get only two buttons on comment flags: “delete” and “dismiss”; the latter makes the flag go away and marks it as declined in the flagger's history. Therefore, if you're requesting anything other than “delete this comment”, it's better if you do it through a post flag, rather than a comment flag.</p>

<p>If you think a short comment conversation is obsolete, delete your half and flag the other half. If you think a long comment conversation is obsolete, flag the post. Moderators have a button to delete all the comments on a post.</p>

5,"<p>A new system for moving comments to chat <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/237976/156248"">has been implemented</a>. Basically, posts are auto-flagged if there are too many comments, enabling mods to copy all comments to a new chatroom (and then spend some time deleting what doesn't belong on both side [sic]).</p>

<li><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/28829"">Name for class of algorithms preserving accuracy/confidence</a> -- the question needed (and maybe needs) some discussion in order to be clear/feasible at all. Might have been better to take that to a chat room.</li>

5,"<p>Great analysis.  Based on the data so far, it looks like 5 would be a reasonable threshold: a post with more than 5 comments within 3 days would raise a flag to moderators.</p>

<p>This doesn't necessarily mean that the right answer for all of those flags -- or even for most of those flags -- is going to be to move all of the comments to chat.  However, the data does seem to support the implication that, in most of those cases, the large number of comments is a symptom that there's something not quite right and some kind of moderator action might be appropriate.  The exact moderator action might be different in different situations (move all comments to chat, move some comments to chat, close the question, post a comment with a reminder of site policies, or something else).</p>

<p>So, I think the data does support <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/93444/provide-a-tool-for-moderators-to-migrate-comments-to-chat/237976#comment780395_237976"">Raphael's suggested threshold</a> of 5, and it looks to me like his suggestion makes a lot of sense.  Good call!</p>

This tag has at least three different meanings in the context of cs.se.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/operating-systems"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;operating-systems&#39;"" rel=""tag"">operating-systems</a> sense, in which the <em>kernel</em> refers to the central software component that manages, schedules and controls access to resources in general, and to input/output devices more specifically.  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/kernel/info"">Here is the definition from the SO kernel tag</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;machine-learning&#39;"" rel=""tag"">machine-learning</a> sense in which a <em>kernel</em> refers (I think) to an multi-dimensional operator mapping from one space to another.  <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/tags/kernel/info"">Here is the definition from the CrossValidated kernel tag</a>. </li>
<li>The <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/parametrized-complexity"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;parametrized-complexity&#39;"" rel=""tag"">parametrized-complexity</a> sense in which a <em>kernel</em> refers (I think) to an algorithm input that has been preprocessed into a simpler form that can be fed to an already existing algorithm.</li>
<li>There are several more meanings, one in image processing (although dsp.se does not have such a tag) and one in gpgpu programming  (which is probably not relevant to us.)</li>
</ol>

<p>There are currently 17 questions tagged <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kernel"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kernel&#39;"" rel=""tag"">kernel</a>.  5 of them are from the os.se migration that happened earlier today.  8 more are existing questions that are also tagged <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/operating-systems"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;operating-systems&#39;"" rel=""tag"">operating-systems</a>, 2 more are existing questions that are not also tagged <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/operating-systems"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;operating-systems&#39;"" rel=""tag"">operating-systems</a>, but should be.

<p>There are several possibilities for what to do.  One is to create three different tags <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/os-kernel"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;os-kernel&#39;"" rel=""tag"">os-kernel</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kernel-functions"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kernel-functions&#39;"" rel=""tag"">kernel-functions</a>, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kernelization"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kernelization&#39;"" rel=""tag"">kernelization</a> for the three different uses respectively.  Another is to use <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kernel"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kernel&#39;"" rel=""tag"">kernel</a> in the machine-learning sense, and then use the tag wiki to direct operating systems kernel questions to use <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/operating-systems"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;operating-systems&#39;"" rel=""tag"">operating-systems</a> and parametrized complexity questions to use <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/parametrized-complexity"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;parametrized-complexity&#39;"" rel=""tag"">parametrized-complexity</a>.  (And there are doubtlessly other ways to handle it.)</p>
",CSmeta

<p>I do not think we need a special tag for ""kernel"" in the context of parametrized complexity.  That's a niche topic and I don't think we need such a specialized tag.  As far as I can tell, we don't currently have any questions like that.</p>

<p>I definitely do not recommend using <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kernel"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kernel&#39;"" rel=""tag"">kernel</a> to mean the machine-learning sense.

If we have to pick a single meaning for <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kernel"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kernel&#39;"" rel=""tag"">kernel</a>, it should clearly be the OS meaning, as that is far more common.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it looks to me like that question has some issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Copy-pasted question.</strong>  The CS.SE question is basically a duplicate of a question that was previously asked on StackOverflow: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/25464848/781723"">https://stackoverflow.com/q/25464848/781723</a>.   Indeed, the CS.SE question copy-pastes the text of the question.  The body of the CS.SE question does not seem to add anything substantial over the Stackoverflow question, and it does not articulate a specific question about the answers that were previously provided on StackOverflow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copy-pasted answer.</strong> Not only is the question copy-pasted, but the accepted answer to the question on CS.SE is an exact word-for-word copy of the accepted answer to the question on StackOverflow.  To be clear, I'm not saying Gilles has done anything wrong.  I'm just suggesting that it's not clear that it is adding any value over the Stackoverflow question.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not much value added.</strong> I can't see much value that this question adds, over the prior StackOverflow question.  It's the same question, with the same answer.  The statement of the CS.SE question doesn't add much value.  There is only one other answer on CS.SE to this question, but I'm not sure it is adding much; if I read it correctly, it is just saying ""the answer over on StackOverflow was correct"".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overtaken by events.</strong> The question on CS.SE might be based upon a premise that is no longer accurate.  In particular, it refers to an answer from shekhar suman on the StackOverflow site, but there is no answer authored by shekhar suman on StackOverflow at present.  At present, there are only two answers: one authored by Gilles, and one authored by Martin James (with a trivial edit from shekhar suman, to change the font for one word).  I don't know if shekhar suman deleted his answer, or if the original premise was faulty, or what, but at present the CS.SE question does not make sense, due to this reference to something that doesn't exist.</p></li>

<p>So, it looks like this will be resolved nicely very soon.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I'll give a bit of history. All the steps made perfect sense, even if the overall result didn't turn out so great.</p>

<ol>
<li>vish posted a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25464848/operating-system-processes"">question on Stack Overflow</a>.</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25464848/operating-system-processes/25474030#25474030"">Martin James</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25464848/operating-system-processes/25466172#25466172"">shekhar suman</a> both answered it. (shekhar suman's answer is currently deleted.)</li>
<li>The Operating Systems site launched in private beta.</li>
<li>shekhar suman wasn't satisfied by the answers on SO because they seemed contradictory. So he reposted the question to the OS private beta. Asking an on-topic question which had been asked elsewhere before, but not been answered satisfactorily there, is a good test for a private beta that overlaps with existing sites: can this audience do better?</li>
<li>I, participating in the OS.SE private beta, answered the OS.SE question. I hadn't seen the SO question before.</li>
<li>Since OS.SE was in private beta, thus not publicly visible, and since I felt that none of the answers on SO were satisfactory, I also posted by answer on SO. I felt that the difference in audience didn't warrant tuning my answer in this particular case.</li>
<li>OS.SE closed down (the private beta failed). Since the question was on-topic for CS.SE and not a duplicate there, we included it in a list of threads to salvage by migrating them to CS.SE before shutting down OS.SE. I didn't pay attention to the existence of the SO question at that point, but it wouldn't have influenced my opinion that the question was more suited for CS.SE than SO.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, the SO question got close votes as off-topic, suggested migration to CS.SE. So we can resolve this by migrating the SO copy to CS.SE (not outright closing there, because of the answers there that are worth preserving) and merging the two. Of course, as part of merging, we'd only keep one copy of my duplicate answer.</p>

<p>However, if the SO question had been accepted as on-topic, I would argue to keep it there. We <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64068/is-cross-posting-a-question-on-multiple-stack-exchange-sites-permitted-if-the-qu"">reject double posts</a> because we don't want people to spam their questions on all the sites where they might be vaguely on-topic. However sometimes a question <em>is</em> on-topic on several sites, and might receive different questions to different audiences. This is why <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/16691/why-wont-you-close-a-question-i-asked-and-later-flagged-for-moderator-attention"">we don't close questions as duplicates across sites</a>. If the question had been considered on-topic on SO, I wouldn't have suggested to migrate and merge in this instance (independently of my having answered).</p>

<p>We don't have to nit pick specific questions. Even if there is a <em>bit</em> of an overlap, we are generally looking at the broader scope of the site as a whole. Basically, we are trying to determine if this proposal will attract a new community, or are we just duplicating or splitting of pieces of this (or other) sites.</p>

5,"<h2>Analysis of the questions on the proposal</h2>

<p>I went and analyzed the 40 questions with score 10 and above that define the proposal, checking their suitability for Computer Science.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When creating a programming language, should I choose an LL or LR grammar?<br>
Too broad as is. Squarely on-topic once edited to add information about the language.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the downsides of adding type inference of local variables? That is, does type inference preclude certain other features?<br>
A bit broad. Squarely on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the Switch / Select Case structure worthwhile or can you get away with just If ... Else If?<br>
Elementary, but on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible to make variable assignment a well-typed expression of a functional programming language?<br>
I don't understand how the answer isn't trivially yes (maybe something got lost when shrinking the question down to a title), but anyway, this is dead on topic.</p></li>
<li><p>How to reduce the impact of garbage collection on runtime performance and responsiveness?<br>
Too broad. A more specific question would be perfectly on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>How is multimethod dispatch implemented?<br>
A bit broad, but on-topic. (How it's implemented in a specific language might not be.)</p></li>
<li><p>What features of the grammar for a programming language make it easier to implement a REPL (command line interface)?<br>
Too broad, but on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>How does one guarantee that the commutative, associative and distributive Laws hold for a type?<br>
Too broad, but on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there anything you can do with an <code>eval()</code> type function that would be impractical to implement in any other way?<br>
<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/29589/what-properties-of-a-programming-language-make-compilation-impossible"">We have it already</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any good resources for the design of new languages available? (which features should (not) coexist, what fits for certain domains and so on)<br>
A poster child for too broad, and not suitable for Stack Exchange. But topic-wise, no problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Should a drag-n-drop language (e.g. Scratch) actually be considered a programming language?<br>
On-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the advantages / disadvantages of indent and line break syntax (like Python) compared to curly brackets and semicolons (like C etc.)<br>
Flame-prone, but if it can work anywhere, it's on a site with scientists who are used to backing up their assertions. Risks being too opinion-based, but on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>What, if any, are the benefits of functional programming languages over imperative languages?<br>
Too broad, but on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>What limits are imposed by compilation-to-C? Does it render some language features impossible?<br>
Rather broad, but on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Why does C++ disallow use of unused symbols as operators? (Such as @ or $...)<br>
Borderline, as it's about a design decision for a concrete language. Can be made firmly on-topic by pushing towards the reasons why one would allow or disallow it.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the practical alternatives to conventional 'libraries' for packaging, sharing, and reusing code? Do any of them eliminate configuration hell?<br>
Too broad, but on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>What is being added to languages to ensure they produce provable code e.g. type inferencing, proof carrying code, models that can be verified, i.e. F*<br>
Too broad, but on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a straightforward tool or process to help define a language grammar?<br>
Too broad, but on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a memory-efficient way to implement dynamic array size?<br>
Too broad, but on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>To what extent do type safety and memory safety help or hinder programmer productivity and runtime performance?<br>
That's more of a software engineering question than a computer science question. That being said, scientific analysis of software engineering is an existing, if slow to emerge, field. <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/39/what-is-our-stance-on-software-engineering"">We're a bit waffling on these</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>What properties makes a language good or bad for 'live coding' (i.e. programming as performance)?<br>
On-topic, perhaps too broad.</p></li>
<li><p>Is type inference essential for typestate (e.g. in Mezzo or Plaid) to scale?<br>
Firmly on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>The C++ preprocessor is non-Turing-complete. How do languages with Turing-complete preprocessors (Scheme?) deal with unbounded compilation time?<br>
On-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Wolfram's new language is the first I've seen that integrates a massive knowledge base. What are the security implications of this design?<br>
On-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>How can Hindley-Milner type checking be applied in the design of a new language?<br>
Unclear what you're asking. But all the parts are on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Why do some languages use := for assignment and = for equality versus = for assignment and == for equality, and what are the advantages of either?<br>
Syntax again, somewhere between science and history of technology. Borderline.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the smallest programming language (statements etc.) that not only is Turing-complete, but also useful for teaching programming to beginners?<br>
Flame-prone. But if it can succeed anywhere, it needs to be asked in a venue for people who teach computer science. Here is where they hang out.</p></li>
<li><p>What features are necessary or useful for systems programming, especially embedded systems?<br>
Too broad. Could be construed as a question for computer scientists or for programmers.</p></li>
<li><p>What's the easiest way to hook up a garbage collector to the object code generated by a new compiler?<br>
Would need more information about that compiler. With that, on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the cleanest way to define a type that represents a process with multiple input/output streams? (parallel access, multiple possible errors)<br>
The question needs clarifying: is it about language design (→ CS.SE) or about API design (→ SO)?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I go about implementing a language that allows concurrency?<br>
Too broad, obviously. All the steps would be on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>What features are essential for a PL to serve as a 'systems' language?<br>
Duplicate of #28, which is too broad and borderline.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the known lexer+parser algorithms? Can an exhaustive list of all strategies be created how to transform textual source into AST?<br>
Too broad, on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Futamura projection is difficult to implement. If we go for all-out speed or all-out size (tersity), does it become straightforward?<br>
On-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible to integrate Session Types into imperative language?<br>
Requires a bit more information about the kind of imperative language. On-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the real life programming constructs depending on dynamic typing that are so useful that they can justify using a dynamically typed language?<br>
On-topic. Maybe too broad.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any technical reasons why one language cannot be appropriate for systems/scientific/web scripting etc. usage?<br>
Too broad. Could be ok if more focused, but would also be ok on Programmers.</p></li>
<li><p>Shouldn't product types be commutative? (Int * String = String * Int) just as sum types (Int + String = String + Int)<br>
Definitely on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>In a certain language, the relative position of each token fully defines its semantics. What are the brackets, commas and other punctuation for, then?<br>
On-topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Where can I find a description of the algorithm for a functional language that checks that an algebraic type is fully covered by the match function?<br>
On-topic.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Analysis of the data:</p>

<ul>
<li>33 questions out of 40 are unambiguously on-topic. The remaining 7 are borderline, either because the title given here is ambiguous and could go either way, or because the topic is at the limit of CS. All the remaining 7 would be at home on Stack Overflow or Programmers if not on CS.</li>
<li>Half the questions are too broad. While this is a common problem on Area 51, I think this crop of questions is below average, which doesn't bode well. It looks like most of the questions were written by non-experts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p><strong>The proposal is a subset of Computer Science. Furthermore, it is likely that Computer Science would have better expertise to answer these questions than the founding audience of the proposal.</strong></p>

<h2>My personal opinion</h2>

<p>I am a former academic in the field of programming language theory. I consider Computer Science perfectly adequate for questions in that field. I would find it harmful to split computer science into niche sites. Niche sites do make some sense for cross-disciplinary topics such as cryptography or machine learning, but for core computer science topics, there is no sense in forcing people into cells.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/"">CSTheory</a> makes sense because it caters to a distinctive audience — researchers in theoretical computer science. CS.SE already caters to the audience of the PLT proposal: computer scientists who actually know how to design a language, students thereof, programmers who want to understand the languages they're using, amateurs who want to dabble in language creation.</p>

<p><strong>This proposal is pointless. Interested people should ask their questions here.</strong></p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>One observation: a majority of the users are actively involved in StackOverflow, a very practically-oriented site dealing with issues of implementation and specifics. Fewer than 10% are involved in any given ""scientific"" site (Mathematics/TCS/CS/etc.) While the questions in the proposal might be on-topic here, there might be a bias in the proposal stage for making questions broader, and more academic, than is intended for the real site. I'd imagine questions there would stray into two areas far too much for CS to be a useful place for them:</p>

<ol>
<li>How programming languages are used in the wild. Not on topic here, squarely on topic at Programmers.</li>
<li>How programming languages are implemented. Not on topic here, squarely on topic at SO.</li>
</ol>

<p>Questions about principles - sure, maybe they're on topic here, but we've already got a topic that will be spread across three sites. I can't bring to mind many CS questions that wouldn't be handled well by at least one of {TCS, StackOverflow, Programmers, Mathematics}, but we still had our way. Why not let them have theirs? The argument for a separate SE might get even stronger if they can incorporate the Compilers proposal.</p>

<p>That said, it would definitely be valuable to understand (a) why they want to be different from CS and (b) if they're OK with CS, why they proposed it in the first place (advertising problem? etc.).</p>

5,"<p>When flagging a question as off-topic in the Android app, the reason list has a duplicate entry. The following reason appears twice:</p>

<p>The off-topic list is different depending on whether you have more or less than 500 reputation, which is the threshold between <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/flag-posts"">flagging</a> and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/close-questions"">closing</a>. The list contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reasons defined by site moderators. We have two: one that notes specifically “Questions about software development or programming tools are off-topic here, but can be asked on Stack Overflow.”, and one that provides a blanket statement “This question does not appear to be about computer science, within the scope defined in the help center.”</li>
<li>Migration: “This question belongs on another site in the Stack Exchange network”, which offers to migrate to meta. (Some sites have other migration targets; usually beta sites don't.)</li>
<li>Only for close voters: “Other (add a comment explaining what is wrong)”</li>
<li>Only for flaggers: “Blatantly off-topic (this question has nothing to do with computer science)”</li>
<li>Only for flaggers when using the Stack Exchange Android app (and maybe the iOS app?) as opposed to the website: “This question does not appear to be about computer science, within the scope defined in the help center.”</li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/240390/the-generic-off-topic-flag-reason-has-different-wording-in-the-android-app"">bug in the Stack Exchange app</a>: it should show the same message as the website.</p>

<p>On the website, for flaggers, there is no duplicate entry, but it's as bad if not worse: there are two entries among which the choice is not clear, “does not appear to be about computer science” and “has nothing to do with computer science”. For close voters, it's fine: you can choose to use the generic “not about CS” reason, or you can enter a comment to explain why the question is off-topic.</p>

<p>We could fix this problem for flaggers by removing the “not about computer science” site-specific close reason, and keeping only the network-wide “blatantly off-topic”. But this would introduce a problem for close voters: there would no longer be a generic off-topic close reason, for questions that are just that, off-topic. The first close voter would systematically have to type a comment (subsequent voters see a list where that comment appears as an extra option). We regularly get all sorts of off-topic questions here; mostly “how do I fix my computer” but also pure math and others.</p>

<p>My preferred solution would be to bring back the generic off-topic close (or flag) reason for everyone. It <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184154/closing-changes-on-hold-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-off-topic-reasons"">used to exist</a>, but was removed to introduce close reasons with associated comments, which is of dubious utility.</p>

5,"<p>Something to consider is that, as we keep specializing CS sites, the quality of CS.SE is going to lower.</p>

<p>A question about programming language theory is well on topic here. There is already a flood of low-quality, off topic questions. Segregating specialized questions to their own site means that CS.SE is really only left with the odd general question, and a flood of low-quality homework helps.</p>

5,"<p>I do not enjoy particularly reviewing work, and do not find that SE
always makes it too easy to do. But I do try to contribute, and I try
to do it well, which means in no way that I consider my contribution
perfect.</p>

<p>There was a disagreement recently, regarding question
<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/30570/finding-the-minimum-number-of-calls-in-a-tree/30624#30624"">Finding the minimum number of calls in a tree</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/22341/guest"">User guest</a> reacted to this question with an answer that was not really
an answer, since the question was already answered. But he did not
have enough rep to do otherwise.</p>

<p>The fact is that he had himself given the answer in a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/30555/what-is-the-name-of-this-function-of-a-tree"">question</a> a day
earlier, and wanted to make it known. The fact is unusual enough to
attract attention: I have never seen it before on SE, whatever the
topic.</p>

<p>His comment was humorous and in a style strange enough that it
attracted my attention. But his comment was founded, and did deserve
to be added to the question though he could not do it himself.</p>

<p>I was actually shocked that 2 people had already chosen to vote to
delete his answer, without apparently attempting to do anything to
deal with the issue. As of now, the answer is deleted, and the issue
raised has not been dealt with.</p>

<p>I wanted to deal with the problem and make it apparent that something
was amiss. I do not believe much in Meta effectiveness, and it
concerned the readers of the technical question anyway.</p>

<p>One other thing did bother me: I wondered what Baader-Meinhof have to do
with the issue ... though the rest of the text was fine and rather
amusing.</p>

<p>Then I realized that this was not the only coincidence, and I did ask
the concerned user what was going on.  He did answer, but I am still
wondering.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I agree with deletion.  That was not suitable as an answer in its existing form.  I couldn't identify any attempt to answer the question.  If it was an attempt to answer the question, it was beyond my ability to understand.</p>

<p>Perhaps it should have been a comment.  Maybe ""guest"" was thinking that they didn't have enough reputation to post a comment, so they wrote it in the answer box instead.  However, lack of rep to comment does not make it appropriate to post a comment in the answer box.</p>

<p>(There is a reason that we do not allow commenting until people have gained a certain amount of reputation.  This is not a discussion forum.  If we allowed commenting to all users, regardless of reputation, we'd be at risk of being overwhelmed with discussion and side commentary that doesn't actually answer the question -- in other words, noise would start drowning out the signal.  We do expect people to follow the site rules and the community norms, even though, yes, this does mean they might not be able to comment immediately on other people's questions.)</p>

<p>Or, alternatively, if ""guest"" thought they had a solution to the problem, I think the answer would have fared better if ""guest"" had posted an answer in a more direct form.  As it stands, the point of ""guest""'s answer is hard to follow and indirect.  It reads more like an attempt to publicize their other question than to help the author of the question in terms that they'd be able to understand.</p>

<p>Finally, keep in mind that there was an earlier answer by FrankW that already gave a direct answer to the question.  I'm not sure what value is added by posting a second answer that is worded obscurely and doesn't clearly answer the question, and that doesn't seem to contribute anything in addition to FrankW's prior answer.</p>

<p>I don't think humor (or lack thereof) had anything to do with it, except perhaps that the attempt to inject a little bit of levity may have made ""guest""'s point harder to follow.  Humor is tough on this kind of site.</p>

<p>As far as ""doing anything to deal with the issue"", what did you have in mind?  What were you thinking should have been done to deal with the issue?  I don't see the issues as something that could be fixed by a minor edit.  Rewriting the answer entirely is beyond the level of what others should be expected or required to do.</p>

5,"<p>When looking at a list of questions, for example on page <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/</a>, we tend to assess the interest of the whole compound  question+answers+comments from the vote rating given
to the question itself. But that rating is
usually supposed to be more a rating of the question alone and the way it was asked.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a question may be uninteresting as asked, but have
interesting answers, possibly only one, that may be worth looking at.</p>

<p>This answer may be ignored because the question has a poor vote rating. Low viewing will result, and there may be no reason for another answer.</p>

<p>This happens quite often, and seems unfair to people who try to give interesting answer even when the question is questionable. It is also a loss for users who might have been interested by the answer.</p>

<p>The following question was asked today:
<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/30684/finding-context-free-grammar-for-this-language/30697#30697"">Finding context free grammar for this language?</a></p>

<p>Right now, it is downvoted to -1, actually +1-2. This may be a fair
rating, for a rather trivial question.</p>

<p>However, I found that the answer given by Rick Decker had an
interesting remark (it was for me), and I upvoted it, which I do not
usually do for answer to very trivial questions.</p>

<p>I may of course be wrong in my assessment (I am far from knowing or remembering all the available information). But if I am right, then Rick Decker's interesting remark is wasted.</p>

<p>On the question page, the question shows as: votes: -1, answers: 2, views 29 after 11 hours.</p>

<p>A possibly undesirable side-effect may also be that people may upvote a question they answer so as to attract attention on their answer, even though the question may not deserve it.</p>

<p>So, the above is the problem, as I see it.</p>

<p>Regarding the solution:</p>

<p>One possibiliy would be to rate by a separate vote the question, and the whole
set of question+answers+comments.  But that is too complicated and
heavy on users.</p>

<p>Another solution, much simpler, whould be to rate questions in lists
with the highest vote received by the question or any of its answers.</p>

<p>Then the question would appear on page <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/</a> with the vote rating +1 due to to the upvote on the first answer, instead of the -1 vote on the question itself (which would of course remain at -1 on the page of the question).</p>

<p>This is not the first time I encounter such a situation, and that is why I am bringing it to your attention.</p>

5,"<h1>EDIT THE QUESTION</h1>

<p>Most visitors find threads on Stack Exchange after searching on Google. Google gets us about 85% to 90% of our traffic. Other search engines, and searches inside Stack Exchange, only account for a small minority of the traffic.</p>

<p>So if you want a question to be found, make sure that Google finds it. I don't know how much attention Google pays to votes, but I'm pretty sure it's not much, if it uses them at all. Do make sure that keywords that people might use to search the question are present.</p>

<p><strong>Pay attention to the title</strong>: not only does Google give it a high weight, but it's also the primary way in which people decide whether to follow a search result. Make the title as specific as warranted (“Finding context free grammar for this language?” is awfully generic).</p>

<p>Editing posts to improve them, make them more readable, make them easier to find, etc. is strongly encouraged. Editing is the most open action on Stack Exchange: not only does it have no reputation requirement, but it can even be done without bothering to create an account (unlike asking and answering). There are new <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/239898/new-three-tiered-badge-idea-explainer-refiner-illuminator"">badges to encourage editing questions that you answer</a>.</p>

<p>Searches on Stack Exchange show the score of the post, and higher-scoring posts are likely to get more views. But it's enough to have a high-scoring answer, no matter what the question's score is. The score of the question only matters for a few hours while it's near the top of the front page.</p>

5,"<p>Somewhat following on from this recent <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/944/should-i-ask-a-new-question-or-edit-the-current-one"">meta question</a>, how much of a change should someone make to a question before they should simply ask a new question?</p>

<p>As a case study, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10071/how-to-find-a-local-minimum-of-a-complete-binary-tree"">this</a> question was asked some months ago, then apparently abandoned by the original poster immediately after asking. A few hours ago (at the time of writing) a second person edited the question in such a way that the meaning changed significantly (from ""what is this property"" to ""how do I compute this property"") and invalidated the answer. Some things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>for full disclosure the invalidated answer was mine (this was how it came to my attention)</li>
<li>the original question was, in my opinion, trivial</li>
<li>the new question is much more useful (again, in my opinion)</li>
</ul>

<p>These points aside however, it still seems like a step too far to change a question (with answers, well, one not-that-interesting answer) in such a significant manner (especially after such a long fallow time).</p>

<p>It's obvious in the extreme case of course, where a sensible question is replaced with nonsense, but here it also seems like an evaluation that we should not be making: ""this question is too trivial, and I know a better, related question, so I will <em>replace</em> it"". Part of my unease may also stem from the fact that a second party is making this judgement, rather than the original author working out the real question the wanted to ask.</p>

<p>So what is everyone's opinion on where we should lean on this kind of editing? Should editing always preserve intent, or more pointedly, should we replace bad questions with better ones?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I agree with you.  It's bad practice to make a large change to the question that changes its meaning, particularly when the question has already received an answer and the change invalidates the existing answer.  (I consider this to be true regardless of whether it is the original author making the edit or someone else.)</p>

<p>In this case I am sympathetic to the motivation behind editing the question -- it was an attempt to rescue a bad question and turn it into something reasonable for this site -- but ultimately I agree with you that's not good to change the meaning of a question, particularly when that invalidates an existing answer.  It's better to just let the bad question die an honorable death, and ask a new question.</p>

<p>In this case, the question is apparently copied directly from a book, and without citation.  That's not good, either.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I apologize: I deleted your answer because it didn't answer the question as it then was, but I hadn't realized that the question had been edited beyond recognition and your answer was perfectly legitimate for the question as it was at the time.</p>

<p>It is definitely <strong>bad practice to edit a question in such a way that existing answers are invalidated</strong>. The only case in which this can be justified is if such an edit was necessary to prevent the question from being closed (for example, when different answers interpreted the question differently, and the choice is to close the question as unclear and eventually delete it, or to clarify the question in one way or another, matching one answer but making another answer irrelevant).</p>

<p>In this case, we had a mediocre question with a boring answer — not a fault of the answer, but a fault of the question. It would have been best to leave the question alone and ask another question.</p>

<p>Given that the edited question is a lot more interesting, and that you've answered it, I'm inclined to now leave this thread alone, and keep the revised question with your new answer.</p>

<p>the OP went a long way to write a detailed proof, which he asks us to verify. We end up closing this question.</p>

<p>Let's make a though experiment: Assume the OP asks that questions, and then posts his proof as a self-answer. What would happen then?</p>

<p>I think this could be a nice alternative for closing ""check my proof"" questions, that may benefit other users. </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I don't think this would work well. The assumption is that answers are posted in the belief that they are correct. In contrast, proofs are best checked by taking the adversarial assumption that they're incorrect and demanding to be convinced by the prover.</p>

<p>The expectation here is that a question is a question in the sense of something that a student would ask a professor and an answer is an expert sharing their knowledge on that topic.  The purpose of asking the question is for the asker to find out the answer. This proposal turns the expectation on its head. It invites questions in the sense of examination questions (i.e., something a professor would ask a student) and an answer is an attempt by a non-expert to demonstrate that they understand. The purpose of asking the question has become determining whether the answerer is correct. I think this is a bad idea.</p>

<p>Furthermore, ""check by voting"" doesn't work because correctness is fundamentally not a matter of democracy. For example, I recently posted an answer that got voted up to something like +8 before somebody pointed out a fatal mistake. I deleted the answer but, if the person who found the error had just downvoted, it would still be at +7 and everyone else would still think it was awesome. But, actually, that one person's ""vote"" (as I recall, they didn't even downvote, they just commented) invalidated all the +1s.</p>

<p>Problem-dump questions are generally uninteresting so few people will read the answer and actually check it, especially if it's more than a couple of short paragraphs. Is the answer at -1 because somebody didn't like it or because they found an actual error? (Or even because some people object to self-answering and think it's just an attempt to gain rep.) Is it at +2 because two people checked it carefully and found it correct or because one person skimmed it and thought it looked more or less OK and somebody else piled on? Or, as outlined above, because <em>three</em> people thought it was fine and one person found a fundamental error?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>A major downside of posting a proof for review as an answer is that this leaves comments as the only way of providing feedback. This should only be done when it is expected that the proof is correct and there will be no comment. If the proof is expected to have defect, it can only fit in our question and answers model if the proof is given in the question.</p>

<p>We <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/519/questions-about-correctness-of-a-solution"">don't</a> <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/597/what-to-do-when-the-answer-is-already-part-of-the-question"">like</a> check-my-proof <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/647/what-constitues-an-appropriate-check-my-proof-question"">much</a> here. The problem is not fitting into the Q&amp;A format, so changing the presentation wouldn't affect this. The central issue is that we don't want to debug people's proofs.</p>

<p>Proofs are rather akin to code, so it's instructive to compare Stack Overflow's attitude. There are two different cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>debugging questions: “my code doesn't work, help!” Stack Overflow has an ambivalent attitude to such questions: part of the community wants to see nothing but this (no code → no effort → no answer), another parts hates them (boring).</li>
<li>code critique questions: “my code works, how can I make it better?” Stack Overflow rejects these and sends them to <a href=""https://codereview.stackexchange.com/"">Code Review</a>. Note that Core Review insists on code with no known bugs and having been decently tested; code that is known to be defective is rejected there. The “decently tested” part is a problem for proofs (barring the use of a theorem prover, but the case hasn't come up yet).</li>
</ul>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>It happened to me several times that a question closes while I am
answering. It may sometimes be more than an hour wasted. I would
expect not to be the only one to whom it happens.</p>

<p>Could there be a way such that someone who is working on an answer
gets warned of impending closure of the question, and get a delay of
an hour to complete somehow whatever he is writing, at least as a
temporary answer to be completed by editing.</p>

<p>One might think that the system is right in not encouraging posting
answers to questions that will be closed. I do not believe that since
deleting of a question (as opposed to closing) will depend on the
quality of the answers as well as that of the question.</p>

<p>For one thing, good answers to a bad question may be an incentive not
to vote deletion. Furthermore, the system itself discourages deleting
questions with upvoted answers, as ""<em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/deleted-questions"">the number of delete votes
required scales to the number of votes on the question and all its
answers.</a></em>""</p>

<p>Hence, while on can undestand some motivations for closing a question,
there is no strong reason to waste work already done by a user. And
maybe let the community be the judge of it all. After all, that is
what voting is for.</p>

<p>This can be discussed at length, but the weirdest part is that the
system is rigged to give ""<em><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/208206/closed-questions-pay-attention-to-those-who-are-answering/208208#208208"">a 4 hour window in which you can still
submit your answer, even though it is already closed.</a></em>"". That is indeed more than I ask for.</p>

<p>But the the ""post your question"" button is disabled, without waiting
for the grace delay, so that it is not usable ... unless one knows how to hack the javascript, it is said.</p>

<p>I think it is a rather nice question, as it is questionning the nature and role of CS, and asks for some examples. It is always time to stop the flow when there are too many examples, too many answers. But in that case there were few answers.</p>

<p>I asked for reopening as I disagreed with the closure, though I do not see what I should edit in the question. I like the question because I think it is important to show that CS, like other fields, is involved in fundamental problems about the world, why it is what it is, and to make it clear that it is more than a collection of technical recipes, as some people would have it. While technical answers can often be found on the web, I believe that such questions, important for laypeople and for the image of our field are less addressed, especially by technicians of the field. This is an important and critical issue for the acceptance of CS on the same level as other sciences, by the public, by other scientists of more established fields, and by political decision makers, especially regarding CS teaching in schools.</p>

<p>I would like to see teenagers magazine make small articles on those issues,
as they do on other scientific topics. Make the young people dream. An no one will ever dream over a binary tree, even a balanced one.</p>

<p>To compare with another field, very very few phisicists will ever study consmology. Nevertheless, that is one topic that may make teenagers dream an do sciences. That is what the question was about. At least it should be taken as an opportunity to answer along those lines.</p>

<p>That is what I was trying to do. Whether I was doing it well is another matter.</p>

<p>Now, if you think it would help the question to modify it along those lines, I can try that. But some will say I am calling for a list of topic. That is not the case ... ther are not so many topics that can be fundamental and explainable to laypeople.</p>

<p>P.S. <em>Gilles told me I should take the issue here on meta, even apparently for disagreement over one specific question. So I am doing it.

<p>With respect to LaTeX, specifically, I have some thoughts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>In titles:</strong> the less, the better. Not only do LaTeX-heavy titles slow down
loading of question lists, they are -- when more complex -- also all but 
impossible to decipher in RSS feed readers and in the mobile SE app.</p>

<p>A question that is hard to express without LaTeX is probably no good, anyway.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In posts:</strong> most if not all formulae should be typeset with LaTeX. Period.
Make sure you know your game, though; <em>bad</em> LaTeX is no good, either. See <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271/add-short-reference-for-latex-commands"">here</a> for a quick overview and pointers.</p>

<p>Outside of formulae, it's sometimes better to not use LaTeX. It's expensive to
typeset and can also break the flow of reading (because the fonts don't quite match). Common examples would be complexity and language classes; while you would write</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some $L \in \mathrm{CFL} \cap X$, we can...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you should probably stick with</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do CFL and NP have the same closure properties?</p>

<li><p><strong>In comments:</strong> Go easy, but use it if you need it. The same rules from posts
apply.</p></li>

<p>Personally I don't know why this site exists. It makes no sense to have both a Theoretical Computer Science and a Computer Science site.</p>

<p>I suppose the point might be that Theoretical Computer Science is to Computer Science what MathOverflow is to Mathematics? But even then, I just don't think this site offers much. I don't think it's useful to have both. I think there should be one site, or that this site should be renamed to something like ""Beginner's Computer Science"". </p>

<p>The way I see it, the introductory computer science books are on the same shelf in the public library as the advanced computer science books. It's one subject. I don't see why someone that enters undergraduate computer science and asks questions about it (presumably here) should have to give up their reputation and their presence and ""move"" to cstheory because they're now asking 'research-level questions'. </p>

<p>What's the upper bound for what's appropriate here? Because there's no point in having cstheory if cs is going to cover the same thing, and honestly having two sites just for different levels of knowledge is silly. If the issue is that those in cstheory don't want a bunch of low-level questions on their site, implement a strong moderation policy and liberally delete questions that have already been asked and answered.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I do not know whether it's a good way to ask this question, But I do not find any other way to contact the moderators.</p>

<p>How can I accept an answer to a question that has answered in a comment. I have some questions in <code>Stack Overflow : Computer Science</code> Section which are answered in comments below the question. How can I accept an answer to those questions. Would it create a negative impact on my reputation, If it stays a bit long without being accepted.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>In those cases, you cannot accept an answer.  A comment is not an answer, so you cannot mark a comment as accepted.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend you do one of two things:</p>

<p>Write an answer yourself that answers the question (incorporating the insights from the comment).  Then, mark it as accepted.  This ensures that others who come across your question have a nice, clean answer.  Or, you can encourage the person who wrote the comment to turn it into an answer.  Generally, if they haven't done that after a day or two, you are welcome to turn it into an answer yourself.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can do nothing, and don't accept any answer.  That is also OK.  It won't create a negative impact on your reputation.  We won't judge you by this.</p>

<p>In general, if there is an answer that helped you the most, marking it as acceptable is helpful.  It is the best way to say ""thank you"" to the answerer, and doing so gives both you and the answerer a small reputation bonus (you gain +2 reputation for taking the time to mark an answer as accepted, and the answerer gains +15 reputation for writing an answer that was so helpful to you).  It also pushes that answer to the top and thus helps anyone else who may have the same question: if they come across your question, the first answer they see will be the one you mark as accepted.</p>

5,"<p>Because of Miles Rout's answer expressing his honest opinion, I also want to give an answer expressing a personal opinion. I don't really have an opinion on whether a stackexchange site about a subject, which is also an academic profession, should be related to the curriculum of typical introductory and advanced courses for students of that profession. <strong>To avoid confusion, the claim by Miles Rout that computer science is identical to theoretical computer science cannot be refuted by artificially restricting theoretical computer science to a subset of its actual topics. One must name some practically relevant applied areas of computer science instead.</strong> I was one of those who argued against such applied topics in the past, but have changed my mind in the meantime. As mathematician, I'm not qualified to name applied topics belonging to computer science, so please disagree with my list!</p>

<hr>

<p>When I studied mathematics at a German university in the last century, the curriculum of mathematics, computer science and philosophy had (at least) one thing in common: students were required to visit courses in one (or two for philosophy) minor subjects in addition to their major subject.

Because I'm a mathematician, I can't know exactly which topics belong to computer science. I have the impression that theoretical computer science focuses on topics which are challenging from a theoretical point of view.

So here is a collection of topics, hopefully also containing some which don't belong to computer science:</p>

<p>I see there's a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/check-my-answer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;check-my-answer&#39;"" rel=""tag"">check-my-answer</a> here, but the name is a bit unfortunate because checking only the answer is sometimes what a machine can easily do. Insofar I haven't seen this problem here [to the same degree], but on SO, EE.SE and math.SE there's sometimes a burst of ""check my answer to this Boolean/propositional minimization problem"", usually from newbies who haven't yet learned that such problems can be solved (and thus the answer checked) by standard software. Hardly anyone wants to be the typist for such problems... See <a href=""https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/152122/finding-non-essential-prime-implicants-am-i-doing-it-right"">nasty reaction on EE.SE for example</a>. Yeah, it's true that one can also check at least some kinds of proofs via a computer (via Coq, HOL, and what not), but that's way more intricate than what some kinds ""check my answer"" questions involve... So I would suggest raising the bar to ""check my proof"".</p>

<p>On the other had, physics.SE has <a href=""https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/714/how-do-i-ask-homework-questions-on-physics-stack-exchange"">much tougher stance on such issues</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's not enough to just show your work and ask where you went wrong. If you just need someone to check your work, you can always seek out a friend, classmate, or teacher. As a rule of thumb, a good conceptual question should be useful even to someone who isn't looking at the problem you happen to be working on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps another distinction along those lines is that the aforementioned physics.SE policy encourages the use of a [homework tag] (at point 4), while a similar tag on math.SE <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/16425/fate-of-the-homework-tag-the-community-voted-now-what"">was burned down</a>.</p>

5,"<h1>NO</h1>

<p><strong>We close questions because they cannot or should not be answered</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Duplicate: we don't want to answer the question because it's already been asked and answers before.</li>
<li>Off-topic: we don't want to answer because the question is outside our area of expertise, so answers cannot be trusted.</li>
<li>Unclear: we can't answer because the it isn't clear what the question is about.</li>
<li>Too broad: it would be unreasonable to expect a decent answer because there's too much to say.</li>
<li>Primarily opinion-based: answers would be a soapbox for the answerers rather than helpful advice.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this has to do with effort. It's possible to have questions which are on-topic and would lead to reasonably-scoped, interesting answers, with the asker spending zero effort. Copying a question from elsewhere is an obvious example. It makes no sense to arbitrarily prevent questions from being answered based on an unavoidably subjective assessment of the state of the asker's mind. Closure is based solely on the question's content, and specifically on whether it is answerable.</p>

<p>There is a tool on Stack Exchange whose description is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is downvoting. <strong>“Shows too little effort” is a valid reason to downvote</strong>.</p>

<p>There is some correlation between a lack of effort and an unanswerable question. For example, if a question is unclear, then both closure and downvoting are suggested. But there is a reason why closure and downvoting are different tools. Some questions warrant one and not the other.</p>

<p>We only close homework questions when they are not answerable. <strong>You are not supposed to close a homework question because the asker was lazy</strong>. Common reasons to close homework questions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The question doesn't stand on its own. For example, it's a continuation of a previous exercise, or of material seen in the lecture, and can't be understood without it.</li>
<li>The question lacks information about what answers can assume. While it would be possible to answer it, the answer may end up going well over the asker's head, using theorems that the asker is supposed to derive from first principles, etc.</li>
<li>The question is an exercise that requires applying several concepts in a straightforward way. Explaining one of the concepts involved would be ok, but explaining all of them would be too much.</li>
<li>The question is a scan of text. This is an exception — we have a <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/752/should-we-do-anything-about-questions-that-are-just-a-scan-of-a-problem-in-their"">consensus</a> that readers aren't supposed to decipher the text on images.</li>

<p>If you think a question is valid but the asker was lazy, the correct behavior is to downvote the question but leave it open.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am working on Integer Factorization problem, and I came to idea of applying <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/30558/using-fermats-sieving-in-multiplication"">Fermat's sieving improvement</a> in multiplication. </p>

<p>Let it be $N$ the value we want to factor, such that
$$N = ab$$</p>

<p>Now I want to take a small prime value $k$ and find all the possible values of $a$ such that:
$$(a\mod k)(b\mod k)=N\mod k$$</p>

<p>This will allow me to find the factors of $N$ by using the next algorithm</p>

<pre><code>    set 'options' as a group of all the values of a as described above

    while i smaller than N do
        while j smaller than options length do
            test if i*k + options[j] is a factor, in case it is, finish and print it
            set j to j + 1
        end while loop
        set i to i + k        
    end while loop
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't stops here, next I want to take the next prime value after $k$, let it be $l$, find it's group of optional values of 'a', and merge it with the 'k' group, using the next algorithm</p>

<pre><code> return all the shared values of j and l groups over jl cycle
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I don't know if applying the factory algorithm on 'l' group will find the factor $a$ or $b$, so I can't know for sure if the merged group will find the factor $a$</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>For the next input</p>

<ul>
<li>$N$ - big integer with only two non trivial factors.</li>
<li>$k, l$ - two small primes</li>

<p>I want to get the next output</p>

<ul>
<li>a group of integers between 0 - $kl$ that has less than $kl$ values and can be used in my factory algorithm to find the factors of $N$, the group should be created using the merge as described above.</li>

5,"<p>If you get rid of Java and replace it with concise pseudo code, I don't why I not.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Yes, you could.  However, I don't know that it's going to be very well received unless you also make some significant improvements to your explanation of the question.  Right now the question is hard to understand and rather incoherent.</p>

<p>The fact that it's closed on CSTheory doesn't automatically make it ineligible here.  CSTheory is focused on research-level questions, whereas we don't have that requirement here, so a question that was closed because it wasn't research-level could potentially be a good fit here.</p>

<p>That said, your question has many other issues that I strongly encourage you to fix before you post here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Java code is inappropriate here.  Use pseudocode, and make sure it is concise.   People are unlikely to read a wall of text or a wall of pseudocode.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your question is very clear, and define all terms before using them.  Right now it's hard to extract what your question is.  It seems your question is an algorithm design question, but you have not clearly specified what problem you want  an algorithm for.  You say ""How can I make the merge?"", but you haven't defined what you mean by ""the merge"".</p>

<p>A good tip for specifying algorithm design problems is to describe the input, the desired output, and give a mathematical specification of what correct output is.  If you have other requirements, give them as well.</p>

<p>Also, it's not at all clear what ""without been worry to get both a and b sieved out"" means.  Please, take the time to proof-read through your question and state it as concisely and clearly as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, I find it extract what's going on with the first few paragraphs of your question.  You are just throwing around equations but it's not clear to me where the quantities come from or what you are trying to achieve or what those equations have to do with  your goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the other challenge is that you are trying to ask about solving a known-hard problem that has been studied extensively, a problem that requires considerable mathematical background to make progress on and where progress requires a deep understanding of past work and known barriers to progress, yet the question does not show any evidence of having reached that level of understanding.  This makes it less likely that the question will be valuable or useful to others.</p>

<p>The premise of your question is that a solution to your specific algorithm design problem is going to give you a fast factoring algorithm (something tons of researchers have tried and failed to achieve).  However, given this history, it's not likely that you're going to be able to find a fast factoring algorithm, especially given that your question doesn't appear to demonstrate knowledge of the background needed to understand the existing literature on this area, and given that the question does not seem to demonstrate awareness of even the most basic barriers to a solution (such as the need to avoid enumerating through exponentially many candidate factors).  Therefore, questions of the form ""help me debug my hopeless broken algorithm to this known open problem"" are going to be very challenging to turn into a good question, and are going to require extraordinary effort on your part to articulate a good, well-researched question that will be helpful to others.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think in this case there's a few of intertwined things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I suspect that Raphael was commenting with his user hat on, rather than his mod hat - that is, his comment should be viewed as his interpretation and contribution, rather than a ruling in his capacity as a moderator (not that I'm suggesting you necessarily thought this, but it's a point worth making in this situation).</li>
<li>The question itself, to me at least, seems like a question encountered in a basic theory and/or algorithms course (not that it necessarily was, just that the content and level is equivalent), and thus suggestions for implementation details are in some sense ""outside the scope of the question"". So from a pedagogical perspective, which in some sense is the perspective from which questions are answered on a Stackexchange site, it is superfluous and perhaps confusing to add tangential comments. The ideal would be that the questioner, if they were interested in implementation, would then ask a second question. The problem of course is whether a comment or answer (or part thereof) is tangential is sometimes a matter of opinion, but to balance this, there's a voting, editing and eventually a moderation system (which is reserved for abuses of the system).</li>
<li>There's an ongoing effort to provide as clean a demarcation between CS and StackOverflow, for a number of reasons, but basically to assist in curation and helping people to find the information in the future. SO tends to migrate the theoretical, non-implementation related questions to CS, and CS tends to migrate the implementation specific questions to SO. This system is not perfect, bits of both end up in both places, and the precise line is hard to identify; there's broad implementation issues that are quite at home on CS, rather than SO, and so on. For example a question about the theory of tail-recursion and optimisation would be perfectly acceptable, a question about whether and how Haskell does it would be outside the scope of CS.</li>
</ol>

<p>So for your comment in particular, I think #2 is the central issue, though #3 probably plays into it, but again, in this case, I wouldn't take Raphael's status as a mod as important, so it's not an issue of policy.</p>

<p>I'm sure these edits are made in good faith but they should be rejected. They waste reviewers' time in the edit queue. If accepted, they waste reviewers' time in the reopen queue by triggering a vote that can only result in the question being left closed (of the four entries in the reopen queue today, three were of this type; in the past, it was unusual to have four reopen votes in a week).

<li>If you think it should be reopened, vote to reopen. Do edit it first if you can think of any improvement that would make the question clearer.

<li>If you think the question should be closed in its present state, but could be reopened if the author improved it, please leave a comment to guide the author.</li>
<li>If you think the question should be closed in its present state, but the question has useful answers, consider editing the question to make it a clear, on-topic question which matches the answers. In such cases, preserving the answers trumps preserving the original intent of the question. After editing, vote to reopen. If you can't vote to reopen but you're confident that the question should now be reopened, flag the question with a short explanation of why you think the question should be reopened (“bob's answer is the clearest presentation of homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space I've ever seen, and I edited the question to match”).</li>
<li>If you think the question should be closed in its present state, that it has answers that are definitely worth preserving, but you don't know how to edit the question to match, consider asking for help in chat or on meta.</li>
<li>If you think the question should remain closed forever and the answers, if any, are off-topic, redundant or not exceptionally interesting, then vote to delete if you have enough reputation to do so; if you don't, leave the question alone.</li>

5,"<p>We used to have a tradition of closing problems that showed too little effort as ""unclear what you are asking.""  The rationale was that we didn't want to answer questions that are ""just little puzzles designed to make you learn a concept,"" because (a)  such questions and answers are rarely useful to anyone other than the OP (because they aren't part of any real problem, they are just a little puzzle designed to make you learn) and (b) if we answer the question then the questions isn't even useful to the OP, because then the OP doesn't get the practice thinking it through for themselves.</p>

<p>Instead we would put a comment something like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What have you tried? Where did you get stuck? We want to help you with your specific problems, not just do your work. However, as it is we don't know what this problem is and thus how to help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(from the link that @David Richerby posted.)</p>

<p>This is the justification for closing as ""unclear what you are asking.""  It is unclear to us what the OP's real missing knowledge is, so we can't provide an answer that will help the OP or future visitors.</p>

<h2>However</h2>

<p>Stack exchange has long had a much better mechanism for dealing with problems of exactly this type.  It's the downvote.  If you hover over the question downvote button you will see that the tooltip says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful.</p>

<a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/993/should-we-have-a-close-reason-shows-too-little-effort"">Should we have a close reason &quot;shows too little effort&quot;?</a></p>

<p>And he links to a very detailed answer from @shog9 on meta.se that weighs many different pros and cons: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/210840/should-stack-overflow-and-stack-exchange-in-general-be-awarding-as-for-effor/210868#210868"">Should Stack Overflow (and Stack Exchange in general) be awarding &quot;A&quot;s for Effort?</a></p>

<p>@shog9's last paragraph really drove the point home for me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During all of the recent discussions surrounding the close queue backlog, something's been bothering me... A pretty big chunk of the backlog is taken up by questions flagged or voted on using this ""minimal understanding"" reason. That's not surprising in the least - but it's a horribly inefficient way of dealing with these questions. It takes 5 voters to close a question, and because some amount of subject knowledge is required to properly evaluate them finding the right voters is extra-difficult. Meanwhile, folks who interpret the reason as ""no effort shown"" are pushing more and more questions into the queue every day...</p>
  
  <p>...If they just down-voted the questions, a privilege available to nearly everyone flagging them, they'd drop out of sight a lot faster.</p>
  
  <p>As shocking as the notion that someone might get their work done for free is, <em>that's not a particularly compelling reason to put a lot of effort into closing a question.</em>  And if we factor out the downvoting guidance (""This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful"") from our close reasons, they could become considerably more straightforward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis added.)</p>

<p>I was already uncomfortable with our habit of closing as ""unclear what you are asking"", but ever since that answer by @Gilles I've been actually voting ""Leave Open"" on most of these.  (It's actually even more of a pain because you can't downvote from the review queue.  If I think the question really deserves a downvote instead of a close-vote I have to open it in another tab.)</p>

5,"<p>I hesitated for some time, but recently edited <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/41058/472"">this question</a>. As can be seen from the question history, the question contained (or contains) quite a bit of latex commands that were used for formatting the text. To me, this does not look good nor readable. I learned from the OP that this is personal style he prefers. </p>

<p>Perhaps generalized a bit, my issue is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to maintain and improve site quality, that includes making content more readable.</li>
<li>I don't want to annoy anyone by editing things they think look good.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I go ahead and edit, rollbacks probably happen and perhaps multiple people get annoyed for different reasons. If I think it's unreadable, I could downvote and thus maybe encourage different style, but I still leave behind content which I think could easily be improved. There seems to be no way of making the community vote on which version the question or answer should settle for.</p>

  <p>How should one deal with formatting that one doesn't like, and the person who created it does?</p>
</blockquote>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>For those who can't see it, that question previously contained things like <code>\hspace{-0.02in}</code>.  Juho edited the question to remove those manual formatting idiosyncracies.</p>

<p>Yes, go ahead and remove those LaTeX commands that manually tweak the spacing in this way.  I think your edit was a good one that improves the question, and I think it was fair game.  Go ahead and make changes that improve the question.  Posts on this site are community-owned; as <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/editing"">our help page says</a>, ""If you are not comfortable with the idea of your contributions being collaboratively edited by other trusted users, this may not be the site for you.""  If the original author objects, they can roll back the change and leave a comment to justify the rollback (before rolling back such changes, please be sure that they made the post worse, and do leave a comment providing justification).</p>

<p>Regarding this particular situation, using LaTeX commands to manually tweak spacing and alignment is usually not a good idea.  I presume that the original author is doing that to try to tweak the spacing, but this might not be such a great idea, because it won't have the same effect on everyone's machines.  The author might like how things look on his own machine a little better with those tweaks, but (a) not everyone will agree, and (b) they can make things look a lot worse for other viewers on other machines.   Those commands can cause the alignment to look all messed up for people whose setup is slightly different than the author's (e.g., different operating system, different browser, different MathJax renderer, different screen resolution).  I've seen other comments from this author that had atrociously bad line breaks when viewed in my browser, because those comments included LaTeX commands to manually tweak the spacing.  So, this is not a theoretical risk.</p>

<p>This is good general advice for using LaTeX in any setting -- you should generally try to avoid manually messing with LaTeX's spacing/formatting, as usually LaTeX knows how to typeset things better than you do -- but it's even more true in this setting, where we want mathematics that will be displayed in a reasonable way for everyone, regardless of browser, operating system, screen resolution, etc.</p>

<p>That said, the stakes are very low.  If the spacing is not quite right for some viewers, no one is going to die.  If you make an edit and the original author objects and rolls back the edit, don't get involved in a rollback war -- don't roll back their rollback.  If the original author rolls back your change and you're not convinced by their reasons, flag the post for moderator attention and let the moderators sort it out.  Do feel free to go ahead and make edits that you think are a good idea, but if the author objects, let the moderators handle it.  It's not worth causing agita or hurt feelings over this.</p>

5,"<p>Generally speaking, personal style should be left alone as long as it doesn't hurt the legibility of posts. If you prefer to use British spelling, we won't edit your post to remove the “u” from your posts on the four-colour problem. On the other hand, if your religion forbids the use of the Shift key, we will edit your posts to capitalize the first letter of sentences and proper names, because all-lowercase text is markedly harder to read.</p>

<p>Coming to the specific issue at hand, your edit was entirely warranted. <strong>Ricky</strong>, you have been told many times over the years that your microformatting does not do what you intend. <strong>Stack Exchange does not support precise visual formatting</strong>. For example, here is a screenshot of your <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/31077"">CSTheory question</a> taken on my phone (the previous revisions of your CS.SE post looked bad in the same way, but accessing older revisions is a bit awkward, which is why I'm using a different example):</p>

<p>Your forced line breaks look fine when you look at your post in <em>your</em> browser, but they sometimes look different in someone else's browser with a different font (sometimes what the site displays depends on available fonts) or a different window size, and they usually look bad in a different interface (mobile site or app) or at a different zoom level. Your comments sometimes look bad as soon as the timestamp at the end changes. <strong>Please stop doing this</strong>. Don't attempt to use visual formatting: the improvements are extremely minor when they work at all, and for many of your readers, they make your posts a lot harder to read.</p>

5,"<p>Is it appropriate to modify the tags of a question to better reflect
the issues that appear important with respect to answers?</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, how far can it go?</p>

<p>For example, an answer might show that the question is just a special
case of something more general that could call for somewhat less
specific tags.</p>

<p>My concern is that tags are supposed to help find the information, not
just the question.</p>

<p>Another possibility would be to allow some extra tags on the questions
... but that is proably a significant implementation change.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>It can be appropriate to retag a question to use tags that the asker wouldn't have thought of before reading the answers. If the asker's problem is a well-known one and the solution intrinsically calls for concepts that the asker didn't know about, then adding tags corresponding to these concepts is warranted.</p>

<p>Fictional example: someone asks whether it's possible to generalize regular languages and finite automata to parse nested parentheses, with the tags <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/formal-languages"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;formal-languages&#39;"" rel=""tag"">formal-languages</a> <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/automata"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;automata&#39;"" rel=""tag"">automata</a>. Answers will naturally mention context-free languages and pushdown automata. Adding the tags <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/context-free"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;context-free&#39;"" rel=""tag"">context-free</a> and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pushdown-automata"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;pushdown-automata&#39;"" rel=""tag"">pushdown-automata</a> would be reasonable, because the question is also useful for people who do know what PDAs are but not their applicability to parsing parentheses.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, tags should not be driven by answers. For example, tagging a question about a concept that an answer describes in detail, but that other good answers to the question might not mention at all, wouldn't be appropriate. But the choice of tags can be driven by more knowledge about the question than what the asker has. Tags are for everybody who might be looking for the question.</p>

Full answers are unlikely to help the asker beyond gaining exercise credit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not want hint-only answers.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Questions that scream for hint-only answers are usually SE-bad themselves; if <em>you</em> think it does not admit/deserve more than a hint, there <em>probably</em> is something wrong with the question.
We should <strong>not encourage bad questions</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Hint-only answers are <strong>SE-bad</strong>. They are motivated by the behaviour of the original asker (and reasonable as a response to a problem dump!) but this motiviation goes away quickly. In the long run, any question-answer-pair has to be independently useful to search-engine users.</p></li>
<li><p>If the hint is a good one, even a hint-only answer <strong>encourages the original asker to ask bad questions</strong> (because they got the help they needed).<br>
Yes, this applies to hints as comments, too.</p></li>
<li><p>Upvoted hint-only answers will <strong>count as ""answered""</strong> for the platform despite not being fully answered.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to provide a hint now and answer later (maybe because you think the problem is interesting but you don't want to encourage cheating), you can <strong>comment now and post a full answer later</strong>. The hint + spoiler format can be useful.</p></li>

5,"<p>I think the issue can be resolved through rigorous semantics.  A ""question"" in the form ""I don't know where to even start, please help!""  Isn't really a question at all.  It's a request for help.  Bad questions in this form can be edited into the form ""What are the initial steps for starting to solve the problem..."".  This form has two advantages: 1) it is actually a question. 2) A ""hint-only answer"" is actually a complete answer to this question, since the hint will provide the initial steps for getting started.  So semantically this solution holds.  I think it is useful as well, because other people from, say, Google, may also be looking for how to get started.</p>

It is 4 related questions (really 4 sides of the same coin, if I may
say) aiming at testing understanding of polynomial reduction and
equivalence.</p>

<p>This also questions the ""only one question per question"" policy, which
should not be taken too litteraly. In this case, it is really one
question, with 4 facets. I am saying that for completeness, but I do
not want to be accused of raising an independent problems in an answer.</p>

<p>It may be more interesting to me as I have little experience in this
view of complexity, though I do realize it is elementary for many CS
users. But I think my less expert view is an advantage, since the site
is not supposed to help only experts.</p>

<p>As it is, I found the question interesting (I did not check whether it
was a duplicate). It made me think about these issues, and get a
better understanding of what is implied by polynomial equivalence.</p>

<p>Having these questions, less obvious to me than I first thought, and
the answers of the poster, together with his reasonning (which may
call for more than yes/no answers) was an opportunity to discuss the
issues, because some answers are wrong (I think) and because some are
true, but maybe not for the reason given.</p>

<p>Fearing the question might get closed (from 2 downvotes, from 1
closing vote, and from the first comment), I edited the question to
attempt to give it more conformance to question standards. I might
also have risked an answer, I do not know. Unfortunately it seems that
the users got the first messages (he has 10.2k rep on Stack Overflow,
so he knows the rules of the game) and deleted the question himself,
which I regret.</p>

<p>This question is only an example, and the opportunity to voice more
precisely issues that have been bugging me. And at the same time, it may reopen the issue and raise awareness of the policy.</p>

5,"<p>I just noticed that I (among four others) was the <strong>""top reviewer of all time""</strong> on cs.meta, with one review (which I don't even recall making). Does this seem as pointless to you as it does to me? Do we really need a review queue here? Do we really need a review queue on <em>any</em> meta site? Should I be asking this on SE.meta? Should I even care?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Meta sites just use the SE software (with some modifications), for better or worse. So it figures there'd be a review queue. I agree that they could be turned off here.</p>

<p>They are probably necessary on sites with more Meta volume, though. <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/"">meta.SO</a>, for instance, has more traffic than our main site.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Meta has question closure and tag wikis like anywhere else. Why would we turn the queues off here?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>After my recent discussion starter (<a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1033/towards-a-policy-for-hint-only-answers"">Towards a policy for hint-only answers</a>) and some chat conversations, I think that the biggest problem we have with questions now is <em>if they don't contain a (real) question</em>.</p>

<p>While a definition of what we mean by <em>real question</em> is pending (right now, we are acting on a template basis with an ""I know it when I see it"" paradigm), I think this covers the most common problem posts: <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/751/98"">dumps</a> and <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/722/98"">check-my-work</a>.</p>

<p>Why do I think these are problematic? Well, we don't <em>want</em> them but we don't have a clear-cut argument for closing. We often use ""unclear"" which confuses people; it usually is <em>quite</em> clear what the OP wants! It's not clear what their <em>problem</em> is, though; in other words, there is no <em>real question</em>.</p>

<p>SE used to have a closing reason ""not a real question"", which I think would be more apt for these types of question-posts. We <em>can</em> bring it back as a custom close reason, if we want to.</p>

<p>So, here's my query for discussion:</p>

<ol>
<li>What constitutes a <em>real</em> question for us?</li>
<li>Do we want a ""no real question"" closing reason?</li>
</ol>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The close reason “not a real question” was too broad and unclear. Bringing it back would solve nothing. It isn't any less confusing than applying the current “unclear” to problem statements that are clearly presented but where we don't understand what kind of answers are expected.</p>

<p>The guidance about “unclear” does explain that case (“add additional details to highlight exactly what you need (…) it’s hard to tell exactly what you're asking”); it could use some clarification (“it's hard to tell what kind of answers you're expecting”?), but who reads the guidance anyway?</p>

<p>We can add one more per-site close reason. Unfortunately, these reasons have to be under off-topic (allowing per-site close reasons that aren't under off-topic <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/210314/categories-other-than-off-topic-should-have-custom-close-reasons"">has been requested but in vain</a>), so adding a close reason for computer science “problem dumps” is unlikely to alleviate much confusion.</p>

<p>Having a per-site close reason would at least have the advantage of clarifying our policies. My impression is that different people have hugely different ideas of what constitutes “check my answer” types of questions — I've seen it applies to questions that presented a potential solution with an obvious questionable step. The situation is even worse with “problem dumps”, and heads back to one of the reasons why we didn't make “homework” a close reason¹ — the boundary between a problem dump and a perfectly reasonable question is pretty fuzzy.</p>

<p>¹ <sub> Not the only reason — “homework” carries the much worse problem that it seeks to distinguish on how the problem came about, which we can't know and have no reason to care about since it doesn't affect the answer. </sub>  </p>

5,"<p>I am a bit tired of new (and not so new) users who bug you with
additional questions in comments, do not bother to answer comments,
and never bother to vote. They are not the only ones. Some older users
often do not bother accepting an answer of upvoting good contributions
to their own questions. The welcome comment we give in reviews is
intended for new users. However it is seen by many older users and
could be a good reminder for all of the way the site works.</p>

<p>I am personally sensitive to the way my contributions are taken. I do
not mind being criticized explicitly, because I can either learn
something, or teach something of both at the same time. But why should
I work, why should I contribute, when no one cares? I mean, I sometimes
write documents for myself, because I am interested, but I do not
bother putting them online. At least I do not have to expect a
reaction.</p>

<p>Our contributions may not be great, but they are work. <strong>I
taught my children to say thank you</strong> even for a glass of water. I do
not see why I should expect less from users of this site.</p>

post of new users. I may complete it with a comment on specific points
raised by the question asked.</p>

  <p>Welcome to Computer Science Stack Exchange. Since you are a new user,
  remember that the local way to show appreciation for contributions

  question or answer, or accept the current best answer. You may

  mind that answers are intended for all users, with varying
  competence). See <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/tour"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/tour</a>. When posting a

5,"<p>Why was <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/44194/755"">this question</a> re-opened?</p>

<p>As you can see from <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/posts/44194/revisions"">the history</a>, I voted to close it, then one moderator closed it, then another moderator re-opened it.  The side effect of the re-opening is that I can no longer vote to close it; a mod re-open overrides my vote.</p>

<p>This seems like a case of an unadorned problem dump where the poster didn't give any indication of specifically part has been giving them trouble; our policy has often been <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/771/755"">to close such questions</a>.  See also <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/741/755"">this meta post</a> and <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/775/755"">this discussion</a> and <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1042/755"">this discussion</a>.  Was there a reason to re-open this question?  Shouldn't it be closed again until it is edited to meet our criteria?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I reopened the question because I didn't see a compelling reason to close it. </p>

<p>Our applicable policies are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/468/homework-policy"">Homeworkness doesn't matter</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/740/should-we-downvote-solution-request"">Lack of effort is a reason to downvote, not to close</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/740/should-we-downvote-solution-request"">Problem dumps can be closed as too broad if they require an extensive answer</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/740/should-we-downvote-solution-request"">Problem dumps can be closed as unclear if the asker doesn't specify which part is giving them trouble</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/594/the-return-of-the-homework-question"">Homework questions should be, with about equal support: answered after a delay, answered normally, closed as duplicate whenever possible</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>When</em> a problem dump should be closed isn't something we have a policy for; we've discussed it a few times, but with the usual level of participation on this meta site, no position has raised to the level of representing anything like community consensus. We certainly don't have a policy that anything that looks like a problem dump should be closed — that would be problematic since there's no consensual definition of “problem dump”.</p>

<p>When is it <em>useful</em> to close a problem dump?</p>

<ul>
<li>When answering would require too much effort, because the exercise requires a long solution.</li>
<li>When the problem is made up in such a way that showing a solution won't help anyone other than if they have to hand in this exact homework assignment.</li>
<li>When the problem is not particularly interesting and answers can be found readily so it isn't worth making the effort of writing one here.</li>
</ul>

<p>For <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/44194/theoretical-computer-science-halting-issue"">this question</a>, <em>too broad</em> doesn't apply, the solution is fairly concise. The second reason doesn't apply either, it combines basic notions in a non-trivial but non-contorted way. (In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the question was a duplicate, but if it is I didn't find it. I wish someone would invent a semantic search engine!) Finally, when a question has already been answered satisfactorily, the third reason becomes moot.</p>

<p>Is there a compelling reason to close this question? Not that I can see. Is the web better off with or without complete_idiot's answer? I thought with, hence the question should remain open.</p>

<p>If we're to <em>define a new policy</em> regarding homework-type questions (do you want to ban undergraduate-level questions like <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/"">Physics</a>?), we need to get a discussion on meta with more than a handful of votes.</p>

<p>I'll re-close the question if you give me a good reason.</p>

<p>Apologies for not editing earlier, I didn't have time.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, the reason you can't vote to close is because you've already voted to close once, not because the question was reopened by a moderator. You're now the only user on this site who can't vote to close this question. Since the question has received four votes from other users, I cast the fifth on your behalf.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Given the current state if the system, I think the answer is ""nothing can be done"".</p>

<ol>
<li>As long as there are any votes, you can not know if the asker voted.</li>
<li>There is no way to force them to vote or accept.</li>
</ol>

<p>All you can do is not to answer questions of users that you know to be ""ungrateful"".</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Some users ask a question and disappear. Maybe they found an answer elsewhere. Maybe they don't care anymore. Maybe they they lost the cookie to their account. There's nothing you can do about that.</p>
<p>Users with less than 15 reputation cannot vote.</p>
<p>Any user can accept an answer on a question they asked (except during the first 15 minutes). They are not under any obligation to do so; accepting is meant to highlight the best answer, if it is satisfactory. Just because someone did post an answer doesn't mean it's worth accepting; the answer may be incorrect, incomplete, unclear...</p>
<p>If the asker has indicated that they find the answer satisfactory, but they haven't marked it as accepted, and they're new to Stack Exchange, then it may indicate that they didn't think of accepting the answer. In this case, and in this case only, it's appropriate to remind them of the feature. Link to the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/someone-answers"">help page “What should I do when someone answers my question?”</a>. Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks, that solved it! — Original Poster</p>
<p>@OriginalPoster Welcome to Stack Exchange! I'm glad this answer solved your problem. If you found it fully satisfactory, please mark it as accepted by clicking the check mark next to it. For more information, see <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/someone-answers"">What should I do when someone answers my question?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the user has at least 15 reputation, you may mention upvoting as well. Keep in mind that unless the answer has no upvote, you can't know whether they have already upvoted. Low-reputation users already <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/69775/remind-new-users-to-choose-some-answers/69777#69777"">get a reminder to accept</a> if they upvote an answer on their question.</p>
<p>Of course, don't post any such comment if the asker has not indicated that they found the answer fully satisfactory. Once again, accepting an answer is not an obligation.</p>
<p>Do not, I repeat, <strong>do not systematically leave comments badgering askers into upvoting or accepting answers</strong>. The comment you propose is especially bad because it suggests things that the asker cannot do (upvoting if they have less than 15 reputation, downvoting if they have less than 125 reputation). New users already get a lot of guidance from the system when they ask a question; your comment is at best additional noise, contains much information that is ill-timed, and is at worst a put-off where you tell the user off for something that they might not do in the future.</p>
<p>Any comment pressuring askers into accepting answers when they haven't indicated that they're happy with the answers is inappropriate. Please flag such comments as “not constructive”.</p>
<hr />
<p>On a not completely unrelated note, I think you've got the wrong idea about Stack Exchange. Stack Exchange is not a question answering service. (If it was, I, for one, definitely wouldn't be here.) Stack Exchange is a repository of questions and answers. In the long term, whether your answer gets an upvote from the asker is irrelevant. Concentrate on writing answers that are useful to all readers who will find it, whether they are the asker or someone who will find it in a web search in five years.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I sympathize, and I understand how it can be demoralizing to put in a lot of effort into an answer only to never receive any reaction or feedback at all.  It can feel like you are writing into a void, and that's not very motivating.  I sympathize with the problem you've identified.</p>

<p>Let me suggest a different way to address the problem.  Rather than trying to change the behavior of question posters, a different approach is for the rest of us to make more of an effort to upvote good answers.  Of course, you can't upvote your own answers, but you can help other answerers, by upvoting good answers from others.</p>

<p>In particular, there are two things we each can do to help:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keep an eye on questions on the main feed, and upvote useful answers, even if the original asker has disappeared.</p></li>
<li><p>Look through old questions to find instances of good answers that never got any reaction.  Of course, it's easy to miss good answers when they initially appear, so a second thing you can do is use the site search to find questions where this might have happened, read through the answer, and upvote it if it looks good.  I haven't found a perfect search query that is perfect at finding these cases, but the following is not a terrible approximation:</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/search?q=score%3A0+isaccepted%3Ano+is%3Aanswer""><code>score:0 isaccepted:no is:answer</code></a></p>

<p>If you page through the search results, you can probably spot question titles that look like substantive, meaty questions, and then take a look at the corresponding answer.  Some of the answers are ones that might be reasonable candidates for an upvote.  If you prefer to look only at questions within a particular topic area, you can add a tag to the search query (e.g., <code>[programming-languages]</code> or <code>intags:mine</code>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, this doesn't change the behavior of question posters.  But then again, we can't change other people's behavior -- we can only change ourselves.  So I wanted to share one way that we can all help ensure that useful answers receive some appreciation, even if the original poster doesn't do that.</p>

<p>There's no reason for you to delete your question (and since it has an upvoted answer, you can't, anyway). Nobody has seen it fit to vote to close it so far. So there is no reason to remove this question.</p>

<p>Therefore that's a fine question. Maybe it isn't a stellar question, but that's ok, not every question is the best ever. Please leave this question on the site. As your question is a bit vague, you may want to edit it to be a closer match for the answer.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>It's up to you, but I don't think you need to delete the previous question.  As you say, it is a bit vague, but I don't think it's harmful or terrible.  One alternative to deleting the old question is to look at whether there are any ways of improving it; that would be a win-win for you and for the site.</p>

<p>One thing you could do that might improve the question is to provide additional context, about why you are asking and how you will use the answers.  Your meta question helps clarify that your goal is to kickstart your search, to try to identify the right fields and papers.  It might not hurt to add that.  The other thing I would suggest is to explain the motivation.  For instance, you ask about 'complexity'.  What is it about 'complexity' that and these examples that interest you?  Are you hoping to find insights about evolution, from the computer science literature?  Are you hoping this will somehow help deepen our understanding of some aspect of theoretical computer science?  Something else?  Understanding that might help readers identify fields that might be of interest to you -- especially as there are many different possible meanings and formalizations of the concept of 'complexity' floating around.</p>

<p>Also, if you can tell us what searching you've already done and what search phrases you've already tried, that would help.  For instance, have you spent some time on Google Scholar searching for likely phrases?  You mention ""evolutional computing""; have you tried some searches on Google Scholar for things like ""evolutional computing"", ""evolutionary computing"", ""evolution and computing"", ""computational evolution"", etc.?  If you've tried that, then telling us what you've already tried might help readers avoid duplicating effort.  If you haven't tried that, then that'd be another step you could take that might improve your question ... and that incidentally also might help you formulate a more precise question.</p>

<p>In reverse order, ""hint-only"" answers are not arbitrarily unreasonable, the site aim to build up a reusable collection of high quality questions and answers, and in some cases it is more productive from a pedagogical perspective to provide only the next step (or similar) rather than the entire answer. This is especially true of basic questions - most people will have access to a large number of worked examples already (even on this site) - hint-only answers are a way of allowing the site to address the more subtle issues around developing skills and intuition. That said, some consideration should be put into the decision to only give a hint, rather than a full answer (excepting the case where the questioner is explicitly looking for hints only).</p>

<p>""Check-my-work"" questions are essentially useless to the site. At most they provide a cheap answer to anyone who doesn't want to do any work. They don't offer insight, or solve any precise problem.</p>

<p>""Problem dumps"" are potentially salvageable. The questioner is likely simply unfamiliar with the format of the site, and also likely unfamiliar with how to form and ask useful questions. In this regard ""problem dumps"" can easily become a good starting place for build a <em>good</em> question, but this does take some work in the form of coaxing and coaching the questioner.</p>

<p>Very little. The site is <em>community</em> moderated and the close voting system is intended (in part) to deal with this situation. A gentle comment pointing this out is enough. If either or both (or all) parties are engaged in pathological behaviour, then that's a separate matter.</p>

<p>Nothing. Again, the site is meant to be <em>community</em> moderated, with the formal moderators acting as (to quote) ""exception handlers"".

<p>I think CS's largest problem is retention of users. We see a lot of new users at very predictable times, often with exactly the same questions as the same time last year. The real trick is that very few people progress further with the parts of computer science that can be answered within scope for CS, so each cohort of ""potential recruits"" diminishes in size quite rapidly after a year. One possibility would be to encourage the more active, higher level users to post questions that would be interesting to other high level users, however cstheory is often already a more fruitful route for this.</p>

<p>I think my most important contribution to community moderation is working through the edit queue routinely. While I am not the most avid with regards to answering questions (I prefer to wait for questions on which I can contribute something useful that perhaps others may not), I clear my review queue as often as possible (essentially daily, sometimes twice a day). I involve myself in the meta discussion about the site; in particular I like to keep abreast of the community discussions on policy issues. I try to intelligently contribute edits to questions and answers, but sparingly - editing for editing's sake is a poor strategy (and may have repercussions).</p>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>A first flush, the site is a Q&amp;A archive, but the real use of this is in teaching (formal and informal). The questions that people ask on this site are (hopefully) questions that <em>lots</em> of people are asking, but may not have the support to answer on their own. CS can then provide this support. Simply providing rote answers however is of little value, the readers do not gain insight, and will get stuck at the next question, which the site may not answer, so aiming to <em>teach</em> not just answer is possibly the most useful and lasting contribution we can make.</p>

  <li>What are your plans to engage the community in moderation?</li>

<p>On the face of it, it seems to me that the active part of the community is already steadily engaged in moderation. The of who's been reviewing recently tick over - it's not the same five people all the time. It would be useful to get more people involved in the meta discussion, however this probably depends upon a larger active community.</p>

  <ol start=""8"">
  <li>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on exactly what the flags/arguments are. Flags suggest abusive behaviour, in which case the user needs to be explicitly dealt with. Depending on the nature of the behaviour, a ""quiet word"" might be a good start here. Often people are simply not aware of what is wrong with their behaviour, or that there are better ways to express themselves (particularly online). If their behaviour is egregious, then they should be banned. In any case, the quality of the answers doesn't enter into the decision.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""9"">
  <li>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>First, I would find out why the mod took that action. They may have a good reason that I simply haven't seen. If I disagree with the reason, then I would present my case to them. They may have missed something, or they may have answers that assuage my doubts. If I still disagree, then there are two main avenues open: raising a meta discussion to allow the community to set policy (which in theory should take the decision out of a mod's hands) and acting as a normal user and voting to reverse the decision (in the cases where that's possible). Simply reversing the mod's decision would be a tactic of last resort as this achieves no lasting resolution, and in a case like this it seems like it would be my word against theirs, so neither of us has particular claim correctness. If the mod acted outside their remit (maliciously for example), then the community should decide whether to retain the mod.</p>

<p>Problem dumps: no.  Do not want.  They won't make the world a better place.  But sometimes they can be turned into a far better question by generalizing them appropriately (e.g., how do I prove a language is regular?, rather than: give me a regexp for the following specific language).</p>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I think our biggest challenge is to grow the number of experts and active users on the site.  Compared to other Stack Exchange sites, we have a relatively small core group of answerers, and it'd be great to expand that.  To be clear, things are already working well, and it's not like we're in trouble, but growing the number and diversity of those experts will be good for the site in the long run and will make us even stronger.</p>

<p>I think one of the best things we can do to address this challenge is stay the course and maintain our quality standards.  High-quality questions attract high-quality answers, and they both attract experts to stay.  When an expert wanders by, I tend to think they're more likely to be motivated to continue participating if they see just what great questions and answers we have here.</p>

  <li>What do you see as the mission of cs.SE? Should we be a Q&amp;A repository, a (self-)teaching tool, a homework service, ...?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  We have multiple missions.  We want to help people.  We want to build an archive of high-quality questions and answers that will be useful to others in the future.  We want to help people learn concepts.  We want to share knowledge and make knowledge more widely accessible.  We want to help disseminate some of the deep ideas and techniques form the research literature to people who need those techniques, and help people with problems find solutions.</p>

<p>I don't think we want to be a homework service.  The problem is that the resulting questions tend to be low-quality.  Instead, we should focus on helping people learn computer science.  Usually, the best way to help people learn is not to solve their homework exercise for them, but to help them learn new material.  You can't learn to ride a bicycle by watching a video of someone else riding one, and you can't learn computer science by watching someone else solve homework exercises.  So, a homework-solving service probably isn't the best possible use of this community.</p>

  <li>What are your plans to engage the community in moderation?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing ♦-moderators can do is give the rest of the community a chance to be involved in moderation.  It's a delicate balance, because on the one hand, ♦-moderators can save everyone else some time by taking action when it is clearcut, but on the other hand, I think it's healthy to build up a norm that a lot of the moderation is done by the community.</p>

<p>Put in concrete terms, if elected as a ♦-moderator, I'll probably close-vote just a bit less.  In clearcut cases where I suspect pretty much everyone would agree, sure, I'll still close-vote.  But in less-obvious cases, I might wait and give the community a chance to vote.  I am inspired by something I've seen @Raphael do from time to time, where he posts a comment encouraging the community to vote by saying ""This feels like it might possibly be (too broad/unclear/off-topic/whatever); community votes, please.""</p>

<p>There are also some actions that only ♦-moderator can take, and that can't be handled by the rest of the community: e.g., handling many flags.  That's one that can't be delegated to the community, but ♦-moderator can still engage the community by encouraging people to flag (e.g., by reminders on Meta).</p>

<p>Finally, one of the biggest ways that ♦-moderators can engage the community is by keeping an eye out for any common patterns or problems, and then posting on Meta to solicit community opinion for new cases.</p>

  <ol start=""8"">
  <li>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd look at a sample of flagged interactions, determine whether that user's contributions have stepped over the line, and take appropriate action.</p>

<p>It depends on the kinds of arguments or flags.  If others are arguing about the technical merits, that's not a problem: there's no reason that should require any action at all.  If it triggers flags and those flags are unwarranted, no action is needed.</p>

<p>But if (for example) that user has a pattern of rude or offensive comments, then action is needed.  I would start by acting on the specific flags.  If it's a single instance, sometimes it's enough to just delete the entire lot of comments and let people cool done.  If it's starting to become a pattern, I'd reach out to the user through a private chat, and see if the user's behavior improves.  (These situations are usually best handled privately; calling someone out publicly can backfire.)  If that doesn't work, suspensions or other actions might be warranted -- but I'd consult with the other ♦-moderator first, as they might have better ideas about how to handle the situation.</p>

<p>I'd reach out to the other moderator privately.  But generally I figure anyone elected as a moderator is likely to be a level-headed sort with a good reason for whatever action they took, so if it's a one-off, I'm likely to defer to them.  If I notice a broader pattern, I'd start with a private conversation with that moderator, and if it brings out differences in perspectives, I might ask a question on Meta about what our policy should be.</p>

<p>Over the past year I've read just about every question posted to CS.SE, and I feel comfortable with my knowledge: I'm by no means expert in every area of CS.SE, but I have enough knowledge that I feel comfortable acting as a moderator on the overwhelming majority of questions I've seen.</p>

<p>In more detail: Probably the most common topic for questions is theory, e.g., algorithms, data structures, complexity theory.  I have a solid understanding of those topics: I'm not as expert as some of the other active users here, but solid enough to understand everything I've seen in that area, and often to answer.  I also have a decent understanding of formal methods, HCI, computer vision, machine learning -- I'm not an expert, but enough to understand most questions.  I'm also expert in computer security and cryptography, but we have separate sites for those.  If I had to pick the one area where I'm weakest, it is undergraduate-level operating systems and AI.  I've actually studied systems at the graduate level and follow some systems research, but I've never taken an undergraduate OS course, so I have some gaps in my knowledge there.  Fortunately, we have others on this site who can handle those cases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>What is your take on ""problem dumps"", ""check my work"" and ""hint-only answers"", respectively?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Problem dumps</strong>: I feel we still haven't found the boundary between what should be answered and what should be closed. We all too often close questions based on the effort of the asker, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/210840/should-stack-overflow-and-stack-exchange-in-general-be-awarding-as-for-effor/210875#210875"">which is just wrong</a>. Stack Exchange is not a question answering service, it's a repository of questions and answers. Ultimately the asker is irrelevant; what matters is the question.</p>

<p>Now, some problem dumps are problematic, and should be closed, the problem is which ones. Some are just too big, and can and should be closed as <em>too broad</em>. But there's another category of questions that doesn't fit any close reason, but whose presence doesn't make the world better: straightforward applications of well-known theorems. I'd like to have a policy to close those, either as duplicates of a generic question (like the ones listed <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/599/reference-answers-to-frequently-asked-questions"">here</a>), or with a custom “rote exercise” close reason. But <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/775/should-we-have-a-custom-close-reason-for-homework-assignment-dumps"">finding the right boundary is difficult</a>. I've seen too many questions which could be usefully answered closed as unclear just because the asker hadn't shown effort to throw in yet another close reason lightly.</p>

<p><strong>Hint-only answers</strong>: A hint is <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1033/towards-a-policy-for-hint-only-answers/1034#1034"">at most a bad answer and at worst not an answer</a>. Hints only help the person asking now, they are useless to the next person who'll be stuck at a slightly different place. Hints are fine for a homework help site, but that's not what we do here. Stack Exchange is a repository of questions and answers; the answers are supposed to be helpful to future visitors, otherwise we wouldn't go through pains to make them findable. </p>

<p><strong>Check my work</strong>: Stack Overflow rejects questions of the form “here's my code, how can it be improved?”. It has a companion site <a href=""https://codereview.stackexchange.com/"">Code Review</a> which is dedicated to such questions. The feel of the two sites is very different, which makes me feel that check-my-proof doesn't belong on a general Q&amp;A site either. This doesn't mean that anything that smells of check-my-proof should be rejected. “Here's my proof [3 self-contained paragraphs], am I applying the mistress theorem correctly?” is perfectly fine. “Review my proof of the independence of P=NP” isn't.</p>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>These come in all kinds, ranging from a simple misunderstanding to characterized bad faith. As a moderator, you don't have to step in every time; sometimes it's enough to let the conversation run its course. Often a gentle prod can help, such as gently asking the asker to edit their question to provide a few definitions or link to some background explanation, even if they feel the question is perfectly clear. If the commenter has identified a fundamental misconception, then usually the right course of action is to debunk that misconception in an answer. If there's a dispute that can't be resolved, try to find a topic expert in chat or on meta.</p>

<p>Not enough questions that aren't homework-type. Being neither a professor nor a student, these questions naturally tend to fail to catch my interest. But beyond that, computer science is not just a topic to teach and learn (and research, but a lot of that is nicely covered by <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/"">Theoretical Computer Science</a>). It's also a science that gets applied by millions of engineers.</p>

<p>I'm at a bit of a loss how to improve on that, beyond improving our treatment of problem dumps and hint-only answers. Being the representative of industry among the current moderators, I feel somewhat responsible. I'm afraid I don't have a promotional channel for programmers (unless my tumultuous relationship with Meta Stack Overflow counts). I do try to defend applied science against a strict theoretical view (yes, it's come up sometimes) and to provide a broad perspective when I answer questions (but then by now you've noticed I write too much anyway).</p>

<p>CS.SE is a Stack Exchange site. (A normal one, not an outlier like Code Review or Code Golf.) It's a “question and answer site”, aiming to be a “library of detailed answers to every question about computer science” (<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/tour"">source</a>). I'm close to Joel Spolsky's vision for Stack Exchange, with Wikipedia as a strong inspiration.</p>

<p>CS.SE can be used as a teaching tool. But that's not saying much: so can a piece of chalk.</p>

<p>While CS.SE can be used as a homework service, it shouldn't. Using it this way doesn't help the student (it might help you get a passing grade if your education system is so screwed up you can get a passing grade from homework, but it's not going to land you a job). Using it this way doesn't help other participants. And it doesn't help visitors unless they have the exact same exercise — except that, like the original asker, it doesn't actually help them.</p>

<p>Well, that's a tough one. I've been trying to unobtrusively let the community handle closing and reopening, but after three years we still don't have a critical mass. Still, the situation may be improving: the close review queue is at an all-time low — I hope it isn't just the summer lull in close-worthy homework questions.

<p>The first step is to kindly ask them to moderate themselves. If it's limited to comments, suggest chat instead. If it rises to the level of flags, and it isn't just someone having a bad day, this may warrant a more serious talking to. Ultimately, in egregious cases, ask them — or tell them if needs be — to take step away from the keyboard. This is a collaborative site; if someone can't stand collaboration, no matter how much of a genius they are, it's best for them and us if they keep their distance.

</blockquote>

<p>From experience, there's rarely anything that requires urgent intervention. The only time that's happened on CS is spam waves, and the community can deal with those: 6 spam flags (which only requires 15 reputation to cast) and a spam is gone. And there hasn't been a spam wave on CS since Stack Exchange put in place an adaptative spam filter on their servers. The one reason to spread timezones is that occasionally (maybe a once-a-year thing on CS), we want to have a chat with a user, and that requires compatible times. But it's usually possible to find some overlap even from disparate timezones.</p>

<p>Anyway I live in UTC+1/2. I'm usually sporadically present during the day and more active in the evening. When I travel (a few weeks per year) all bets are off.</p>

5,"<p>We definitely need at least one tag to cover randomized algorithms (that use randomness to do something) and one for random generators (that produce (pseudo)randomness).</p>

5,"<p>I would like to propose feature of enabling JavaScript in posts.
This is site about Computer Science and some question naturally fits into interactive mode, or this simplifies enumerating possibilities.</p>

<p>As example I would like to show some questions:</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/45438/can-a-red-black-tree-be-constructed-of-only-black-nodes-using-rb-insert-only"">Can a Red Black tree be constructed of only black nodes using RB insert only?</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/43762/how-does-this-turing-machine-accept-an-bn"">How does this Turing machine accept $a^n b^n$?</a></p>

<p>Dynamically drawing trees, showing merge operations, or running simple TM emulator to show step by step what is happening would give another way to improve answers. It would be easier to understand concept and with low overhead it could turn answer into useful, interactive resource.</p>

<p>Any problems with this?
I think that execute script on implicit request by user is must have starter.
It could be enabled from some rep level and/or reviewed before accepting.
I do not think that this would be overwhelming task, as this is first request and some questions are begging to be animated while others just can't.</p>

<p>Edit</p>

<p>It is security risk if: script is loaded and executed without interaction. If everybody without high reputation could use it, without revision and by enabling external sources. Everything could be managed and even more importantly it could be literally two embeded libraries executing only animations. Let me give example. User is given only access to Tree builder and Machine emulator. These libraries are internal, so there is no risk of external loading. User must have eg. 300 rep, and it is reviewed afterward to plug it in. Reviewing is not hard to this as there are limited capabilities and there are not many eager to write it.</p>

<p>BTW I today written RBT to make images. If user can only use script to add nodes to tree, what is the risk?</p>

If it seems to be adopted by the community at large, we can think about turning on snippets here.</p>

5,"<p>Not that this really adds a lot, but it at least gives a place for people to vote in favour of discarding <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graph-algorithms"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graph-algorithms&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graph-algorithms</a> and using <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/algorithms"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;algorithms&#39;"" rel=""tag"">algorithms</a> + <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graphs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graphs&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graphs</a>.</p>

<p>My perspective is that this is the more flexible route. We need a tag for algorithms (of course), and a tag for things-to-do-with-graphs (side note, I still think it's productive to have separate <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graph-theory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graph-theory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graph-theory</a> and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graphs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graphs&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graphs</a> tags, in reference to Kaveh's comment), so <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graph-algorithms"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graph-algorithms&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graph-algorithms</a> is simply adding a superfluous tag that may make searching harder; someone looking for a graph algorithm has two fairly natural routes via tags using <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/algorithms"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;algorithms&#39;"" rel=""tag"">algorithms</a> + <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graphs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graphs&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graphs</a>, and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graph-algorithms"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graph-algorithms&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graph-algorithms</a> could possibly split the group of questions that should be found together.</p>

5,"<p>In 2013 I provided an answer to a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/18492/variant-of-the-knapsack-problem"">question</a> I liked quite a lot. In my answer I mostly referred to the technique mentioned in the question but in the end I made a side remark indicating that there are other ways to achieve the same result. This answer has been upvoted since then. Recently, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/37728/saad-malik"">Saad Malik</a> found an error in the second part of my answer and he posted a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/45517/finding-the-n-best-items-in-a-0-1-knapsack"">follow-up question</a> showing the flaw.</p>

<p>I asked him some time until I properly reply to his question (since I'm currently on holidays currently writing this message from my tablet over a phone line). And here comes my first observation: <strong>catching mistakes and making them apparent to the community is one of the best things of stackexchange and, of course, science over all</strong>. I do want to acknowledge properly his contribution.</p>

<p>Of course, the first would be to provide a good answer to his follow-up question. But what else can I do? Any advice would be very welcome.</p>

<p>For instance, I of course upvoted his question and I also upvoted his comment to my first answer but I'd really like to give him more than 10 points. Is there a way to do that?</p>

<p>I'm also kind of surprised to see that noone else upvoted his question. Am I wrong if I say that we should encourage the community to be very favourable to this kind of questions? (note that Saad Malik has been always both very gentle and right, this is not the case of someone posting rubish, much the opposite, the question is very well written)</p>

<p>Also, while discussing broadly how to approach best these kind of questions, I was happily surprised that noone is providing a reply. I understood this as an indication that it is <em>me</em> who should do it (as I will certainly do). So another kind of recommendation would be for the community to allow first to the guy committing the mistake to provide a better and more detailed answer.</p>

<p>So far, the question is quite general. What should be the best practices both for the community and a specific user to approach questions that show flaws in other answers? (I think we should even have kind of a badge for this which I would happily award him :) )</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I suggest you do three things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Edit your original answer to remove the incorrect parts.  Edit it so it is correct, per your updated understanding.  You can additionally add a link to the follow-up question and an acknowledgement to Saad Malik at the end of the answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Answer the follow-up question.  The follow-up question asks ""Why isn't this formula working?"".  It sounds like you've discovered that the answer is ""Because that formula isn't correct"".  So, write an answer that explains that the formula is incorrect and explains why.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if you wish to help give Saad Malik more points, it might be possible to use a bounty to do that.  Bounties can be used to award some reputation to another person, at the cost of decrementing your own reputation.  You can learn more about how bounties work here: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/16065/160917"">How does the bounty system work?</a></p>

<p>However, in this particular situation, there's a slightly tricky bit about using a bounty.  You offer a bounty on a particular question, and then can choose which answer to give the bounty to.  However, you can only award bounties to <em>answers</em>.  In this case, the question you want to reward is a <em>question</em>, not an <em>answer</em>, so it's not straightforward to use a bounty to give Saad Malik some additional reputation points.</p>

<p>I can see two ideas for how to deal with this trickiness.  You could put a 50-point bounty on the question Saad Malik asked, in hopes that it brings additional attention to the question and maybe more people upvote it -- though feels pretty indirect to me, and in any case, the 50 points wouldn't go to Saad Malik unless he/she answered his/her own question.  Alternatively, you could look for some other answer of Saad Malik that is excellent (to a totally unrelated question) and award it a bounty by placing a bounty on that third question and then awarding it to Saad Malik's answer.  That feels like it is stretching the intent of the bounty system a little bit, so I'm not sure whether it is allowed.  (See also <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/135469/160917"">Bounty-like facility for rewarding excellent questions</a>.)</p>

<p>In the end, maybe posting here on Meta was the right approach: it will probably draw more attention to both questions, which might achieve your goals.</p></li>

5,"<p>Related: <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1007/9550"">Trivial edits to closed/on-hold questions</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, we seem to be getting a lot of edits to old answers (two or three years) where the edit does nothing other than correct a particular user's capitalization of words at the start of sentences. Most of these edits seem to be being accepted.</p>

<p>In my opinion, these edits do more harm than good: they take up people's time in the review queue and, more importantly, they bump the old question back onto the front page of the site. This means that recent, active questions get pushed onto page two, where people don't see them. Also, at least some of these questions are ones that I think would have been closed if they were asked today, since the site's standards have changed over time. Bringing these questions back onto the front page encourages people to spend time answering them again.</p>

<p><strong>Please be careful when reviewing edits. In my opinion, edits that just alter capitalization of old posts should be rejected as ""No improvement whatsoever"".</strong></p>

<p>Does this seem reasonable?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>This seems perfectly reasonable.<br>
I had two ideas, so I will present it here (it is strongly connected to posts that you are reffering to).  </p>

<p>If somebody improves (edits) old question, I think there should be answer attached by editor - otherwise, even improving question a lot, it gives nothing. Could it be enforced somehow? Or just deny it for the same reason you gave?</p>

<p>There are a lot of questions that user dropped, nobody responded and user vanished (more than two years, more than one year). Maybe such posts could be deleted? Nobody answered, the only interested person is long gone, and from time to time ""Community bot"" highlights it.</p>

<p>Is it possible to close questions due to lack of interest or accept it if there are good answers and no indication that there are not satisfying?</p>

<p>I was digging by tag to find some questions that are in my field of expertise, but did not answered because probably nobody would care (correct me if I should answer them anyway).</p>

<p><em>Sorry to bash in, but it is matter of days when I will also be able to make reviews, so better to be prepared in advance</em></p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The first thing what I want to mention: correcting grammar makes the things better, it is generally a positive and not a negative deed, even if it is minor.</p>

<p>But: despite that it is a positive thing in a general sense, it may be harmful <em>on the current limitations of the SE system</em>.</p>

<p>In most cases, highly qualified experts of an area have perfect grammar. If there is an exception, it can have a lot of reasons. On my opinion, many of them is acceptable and should be tolerated, many of them isn't. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>He is working in an uncomfortable environment.</li>
<li>The capitals of his keyboard layout are mapped to the non-latinic alphabet of his native language.</li>
<li>Sometimes he is only acknowledged to write in a chatting style on the net. As I experienced, this is somehow <em>very rare</em> in the case of professionals.</li>
<li>Or he is using a braille writing system where using capitals and similar things would be simply unfeasible.</li>
</ul>

<p>There could be another reason against that, and this is that a capital letter correction doesn't worth the 2 points of reputation which can be got for that. This is a systematic problem of the SE, adding major changes to a post extending with cutting edge scientific results worths exactly the same 2 points as a grammar correction.</p>

<p>Wikipedia has a ""minor edit"" box which can be checked on edits, and the reviewers have the option to get the list of the recent changes without them.</p>

<p>Maybe a similar feature of the SE would be also useful, but unfortunately it is over our scope. If it would exist, I would be happy to click this on all of my minor edits. I've initiated now a feature-request <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/265879/suggestion-having-a-clickable-minor-edit-checkbox-on-edits"">discussion</a> about this on the meta SE.</p>

<p>This would also eliminate the problem, that doing minor edits over a (site-specific) acceptable rate highly worsens the site experience of the community members checking the questions ordered by their most recent activity.</p>

<p>There is an obvious argument: if a post wasn't received well, it should have been long downvoted and closed/deleted. If it didn't happen, it can be interpreted that the community accepted that, and this can be enough reason to not let them rest in peace with typos and grammar bugs.</p>

<p>Currently I've found an user whose posts are really on a professional level probably from the academical sphere, despite that he doesn't use capitals. I was aware the bumping problem and so I've reduced the edits to around 3-5/day, but it seems even it wasn't an acceptable rate.</p>

<p>Although it is <em>not</em> a professional site (there is one, the Theoretical Computer Science), on my opinion it would be highly subservient to at least try to follow the style of the professional publications not only in the content, but also in the form.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>I would edit only 3 posts daily.</li>
<li>I would edit only highly upvoted posts (for example, with vote counts over 2).</li>
</ol>

<p>If it is not acceptable even in these, much lower limits, I am ready to stop it all, although I consider a little bit sorrowful to forbid to improve <em>anything</em>.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I basically agree.  If it's just a one or two capitalization errors in an old post, I agree that an edit that fixes only those is too minor: such edits are better avoided.  On the other hand, if there are extensive capitalization errors, such that the fix makes a substantial improvement to the answer, then such an edit could be appropriate.  It would be nice to benefit from the latter kind of edit.  I haven't seen the edits that David Richerby is referring to, so I can't tell where they fit within this spectrum.</p>

<p>I do have one piece of advice.  If you're making minor edits like this, don't go looking for posts to edit.  It's one thing to edit a post when you come across it and notice it can be improved -- that can potentially be OK.  It's another thing to search for instances of capitalization errors (e.g., searching for posts with capitalization errors, searching for all posts from a particular user who you notice has many such errors) -- that should be avoided.  This will have multiple benefits, including naturally rate-limiting your edits to a low rate.</p>

<p>Another piece of advice: if you are editing a post, look to see whether there's anything else you can improve.  This often helps increase the value of your edits.</p>

<p>I do appreciate that you want to improve the site, and don't want to see that attitude discouraged.  However, there are costs to edits that are too minor, especially if you're making multiple of them each day.  So, please take all the comments you've seen here into account.</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account </li>
<li>relevant blogs and websites about computer science </li>
<li>computer science, events, conferences, or meetups </li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

5,"<p>Coming from a perspective of a designer who specialized in typography, I claim that the fact that humanity still uses cuneiform also known as &quot;universal mathematical language&quot; is one of those cases where tradition defeats rationalization hands down.  Pseudo-code is a tribute to this tradition of obscure symbolism, sloppy writing, legible only to the writer but not the readers, comfortable only insofar as to impose less restrictions on the writer, while disadvantaging the readers.</p>
<p>Computer scientists being, technically, a sub-division of mathematicians, will fight tooth and nail to keep the things just as they &quot;had always been&quot;.  Just as ancient Babylonians, who <em>removed</em> zeros from multiple digit numbers <em>for conciseness!</em> (actually, they must've been just lazy to inscribe those pesky zeros into their clay tablets).  Pseudo-code is a modern form of this cuneiform.</p>
<p>My personal experience, as a programmer, is along these lines: most often the subject of pseudo-code comes up during job interviews, where I'm asked to present some algorithm in pseudo-code.  Just for kicks, I tried to represent a Prolog or an ML program in make-believe Prolog or make-believe ML.  You know what: those people asking for pseudo-code actually wanted Java.  Except that Java is a bad programming language, where you cannot avoid writing a lot of inessential details.  So, they wanted Java, but with type declarations removed and literals for initializing collections.  Probably, if they ever saw Python, their need for pseudo-code would have been eliminated.</p>
<h1>History of the problem</h1>
<p>Perhaps to better understand the phenomenon, let's look into the etymology of the word.  Interestingly enough we find that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compile (verb) — The process of producing from pseudo-code a specific routine for a particular problem ...</p>
<p>-- <em>Grace Hopper's Programmer's Glossary, 1954</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>this is probably the first mention that I could find</em></p>
<p>So, actually, in the very early days of programming pseudo-code used to mean any high-level programming language, while <em>code</em> was the shorthand for <em>machine-code!</em>  The rationale for using pseudo-code thus is clear: use a high-level language to allow higher level of abstraction.  It was intended to be compiled, without it, it is gibberish.</p>
<h1>Join the resistance</h1>
<p>Gerald Jay Sussman, the author of SICP, one of the best books on programming, had also written a book on physics.  <a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/sicm-html/book-Z-H-10.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">An example page</a> shows that he chose to use Scheme to represent formulas.  To quote this book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mathematical notation is in one-to-one correspondence with the expressions of the computer language Scheme [21]. Scheme is based on the λ-calculus [12] and directly supports the manipulation of functions. We augment Scheme with symbolic, numerical, and generic features to support our applications. [...] The correspondence between the mathematical notation and Scheme requires that mathematical expressions be unambiguous and self-contained. Scheme provides immediate feedback in verification of mathematical deductions, and facilitates the exploration of the behavior of systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For very complicated expressions the prefix notation of Scheme is often better, but simplification is almost always useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In conclusion: I would discourage the use of pseudo-code as it is used today (say, in LaTeX packages).  It is almost never representative of the actual tools the programmer will have to implement the algorithm.  It is conducive to a particular kind of programming and almost entirely ignores a lot of other valid approaches.  There are better tools, which offer automatic verification, generation of example problems and solutions, convenient editing environments, better typography, which altogether helps sharing understanding of the problem.</p>

<li>Again, this is, basically, Java, with typical for Java and family array access, destructive assignment, <code>while</code> loop and so on.  This code is only ""pseudo"" in the sense that it is pseudo-Java.  It is just bad Java.

<p>I suggest setting a new standard for closing such questions: only vote to close a question if you are confident that you know how to solve it.</p>

<p>A case in point is a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/47799/whats-the-big-o-of-this-algorithm-and-why"">question</a> which was recently closed, although I would bet that none of those who voted to close it know how to solve it off hand.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Thank you for this helpful post!  I agree it shouldn't be closed as a duplicate of the reference question if the techniques in the reference question aren't sufficient to answer the question.</p>

<p>However, I have a slightly different perspective about what lesson to learn from this example.  I do consider asymptotic analysis of an algorithm to be on-topic, if the question is not a duplicate of our existing reference question.  However, it seems to me the burden is on the poster to show their work and demonstrate that the techniques found in the reference questions don't work for their particular problem.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Bad question: ""Here's my algorithm, what is its running time?  I haven't tried anything / I don't know how to start."" ==> will often get marked as a dup of our reference question</p>

<p>Good question: ""Here's my algorithm, what is its running time?  I've tried each of the following standard techniques and here is why each one doesn't work.""  ==> not a dup</p>

<p>It seems to me that the problem with the question you gave is that there was no evidence in the question that the poster had tried any of the standard techniques and no indication of any barrier to them working, and in the absence of that, it seems like trying the standard techniques is the obvious answer. </p>

<p>So, while I do see your point (and I'm glad you caught the issue with that particular question!), I'm not sure a new standard is necessary.  We already ask that people should do research before asking and show us in the question what approaches they've tried and rejected and why.  If people do that, I don't think this issue will arise.  And in my mind this kind of question is a rare case, so I'm not convinced it is frequent enough to warrant a major change in policy.  Just my sense.</p>

<p>The shortest is to just write <code>http://cs.stackexchange.com/q/74</code> in your comment. Unfortunately, the title doesn't get automatically inserted, so the link looks a bit ugly.

5,"<p>The proposed standard requires five people to verify that the standard techniques all fail or, at least, are difficult to apply. That's a fairly large fraction of the amount of work needed for those five people to answer the question itself.</p>

<p>This is a question on how to construct a 50-bit globally unique identifier with sub-second precision using an IPv4 address and a 1-second-resolution timer as stable inputs.</p>
<p>This question is from competitive exam GATE (<a href=""http://www.gate.iisc.ernet.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CS03_2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see-Q-No.-27</a>) , and answer was given by GATE 256 (<a href=""http://www.gate.iisc.ernet.in/2014answers/CS03_2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see-A-no.-27</a>). The original question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every host in an IPv4 network has a 1-second resolution real-time clock with battery backup. Each host needs to generate up to 1000 unique identifiers per second. Assume that each host has a globally unique IPv4 address. Design a 50-bit globally unique ID for this purpose. After what period (in seconds) will the identifiers generated by a host wrap around?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that each host has a globally unique IPv4 Address and we have to design 50 – bit unique Id. So, 50 – bit in the sense (32 + 18). So, It is clearly showing that IP Address (32 – bit) followed by 18 bits.</p>
<p>1000 unique Ids → 1Sec</p>
<p>2^(18) unique Ids → 2^(18) / 1000 = 262.144 (my answer).</p>
<p>Note that if I assume 1024 = 1000 (but this is not fair), then answer is is 256.</p>
<p>I think the answer should be in the range of [256 ,263]. What is the reason that the correct/given answer is 256?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My secondary question is: Are non-practical computer networking questions acceptable here, and if so what is the specific guidance I can use when referring users to this site?</p>
<p>Of course I'll also make it clear to anyone I refer here that the quality standards are just as high here as anywhere else in the network, and that they need to carefully and thoroughly check that their question is as well written as they can possibly make it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The question was re-opened on SO, then closed by a moderator. Regardless of what happened there, I'd still like feedback from the users here about whether the question itself is on-topic for this site, and more importantly, what kinds of non-practical networking questions would be a good fit for CS.  Ideally MSO would have a canonical answer that we can point people to, since &quot;Where do I ask about X?&quot; questions all filter through there. (And we get plenty of comments when we get it wrong. :) )</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>There are two different questions hidden in your question.</p>

<p><strong>In general, are questions about theoretical networking on-topic here?</strong>  Sure.  If it meets with our quality guidelines and site policies, it is suitable here.  Networking is definitely part of the scope of computer science.  As our <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">help page on what is on-topic</a> says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""This site covers theoretical and applied computer science at any level, including but not limited to [...] networks""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So networking is absolutely in-scope for this site, whether theoretical or applied.</p>

<p><strong>Is that <em>particular</em> question a good fit for CS.SE?</strong>  In my personal opinion, that specific question does not seem like a great fit for us, in its current form, for multiple reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's not a question about networking; it's a question about reading the minds of the person who wrote the answer key for some particular exam statement.  The question is ""What is the reason that the correct/given answer is 256?""  That's not a great question.  If you want to know why the answer-key-author thought 256 was the correct answer, then you need to ask them.</p>

<p>As an aside, in this case, I suspect that the provided answer key corresponds to a design that is not optimal, and the author's design is indeed superior.  I might be able to guess a plausible guess at the misconception that the answer-key-author suffered from, but asking me about trying to guess what might have been in the mind of some answer-key-author is not a great question for CS.SE.</p></li>
<li><p>The question is basically a ""check-my-answer"" question.  Our policy is that such questions are generally not suitable here (to give a crude summary of our policy).  You can find our detailed policy explained at  <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/597/755"">What to do when the answer is already part of the question</a> and <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/519/755"">Questions about correctness of a solution</a>.</p>

<p>For such questions, often the right approach is for the poster to re-write their question to ask something that allows for a more substantive answer.  For instance, one could write a conceptual question, such as ""Given a counter with a specific range of values that's incremented at some specific rate, how do I compute how long until it will overflow?"" or ""Given an integer in the range [0,A-1] and an integer in the range [0,B-1], how many bits does it take to represent the pair of integers?"".  Or, one could phrase the question as a design question: e.g., ""I want to generate a global unique ID based on my IP address and a counter, and I'd like to maximize the time for a particular host's ID to wrap around.  I am promised that my IP address will be unique.  I have only 50 bits for my unique ID.  How should I do this, to maximize the time until wrap-around?  What's the optimal design, and what will the wrap-around time be?""  What question to ask depends on what specifically the poster is uncertain about.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, as Raphael <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1136/would-this-theoretical-networking-question-be-on-topic-here#comment3509_1136"">says</a>, it's basically a question about arithmetic.  Once you understand the concepts, it's just a matter of doing arithmetic.  The poster basically asks us to check his/her arithmetic.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, my sense is that the question might not fare so well, if it were posted here on CS.SE.</p>

<p>That said, if the question were re-framed, I think one could come up with a question that would be a much better fit, though it might require some changes to how the question was posed and structured.</p>

<hr>

<p>More broadly, I'd encourage the poster to consider changing how they conceptualize Stack Exchange and how they use it as a learning tool.  This is not an infrequent scenario: someone tries to do an exercise, they get a different answer in the answer key, and then they post a question saying ""Which is right, my answer or the answer key?""  I don't know whether those kinds of questions are likely to be useful to many other people in the future.</p>

<p>Instead, I think a better approach is for the poster to use the exercise as a tool to help them pinpoint some concept that they are not clear about, and then ask a question about that concept.  In other words, use exercises and practice problems/exam problems as a ""diagnostic"", to diagnose gaps in their understanding, and then use that to help them write a question about the concept they are uncertain about.  Personally, I'd prefer to see this site be about concepts, not about arithmetic.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is important to remember that <em>not every question has a home somewhere on Stack Exchange</em>.  There is no guarantee that any particular question will fit somewhere on Stack Exchange; we make no claim or attempt to try to provide a comprehensive network for all possible questions anyone might ever have.  So, the fact that it is off-topic for some other Stack Exchange site does not make it any more on-topic here.  What's on-topic here needs to be considered on its own merits.</p>

5,"<p>Should we delete the C tag?  Coding questions are off-topic here, so the C tag is a ""broken window"" that might be misleading posters into thinking it's OK to post a coding question or post their C source code.</p>

<p>Looking through <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c"">the questions tagged C</a>, most of them are bad questions that aren't not appropriate here.  The majority are closed.  I count only three questions with the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> tag that are not problematic:</p>

<p>All of these would be fine without the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> tag; they have other tags that are fine.  Also, the third question doesn't have anything to do with C, so a C tag is useless here (the only relationship is that the poster included some C source code; however, our policy says people aren't supposed to do that -- they're supposed to use pseudocode -- so losing the C tag from the third question will be no loss).</p>

<p>The potential benefit is that maybe it eliminates one signpost that might be misleading posters.  I have no idea whether it will actually help or not, but it's something we could try.</p>

<p>Earlier, I tried writing a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/tags/c/info"">tag wiki excerpt</a> stating very clearly that programming questions are off-topic here, but it doesn't seem to have solved the problem, hence my question about deletion.</p>

<p>So, should we delete the C tag?  (i.e., remove it from every question currently tagged <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a>, and let the tag be auto-deleted)  Should we blacklist it?</p>

5,"<p><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/679/why-are-there-tags-for-programming-languages"">Once again</a>, no. This suggestion has all the hallmarks of “we must do something, this is something, so let's do it”.</p>

<p>If there was no <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> tag then askers would use some other tag, such as <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programming-languages"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;programming-languages&#39;"" rel=""tag"">programming-languages</a>, or <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/algorithm"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;algorithm&#39;"" rel=""tag"">algorithm</a>, or <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/complexity"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;complexity&#39;"" rel=""tag"">complexity</a> (because the homework exercise is hard, i.e. complex — don't laugh, I've seen it often). Hell, even though we have a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> tag, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/50043/problem-in-combining-elements-in-a-move-2048-program-in-c"">C questions</a> <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/50241/use-of-reference-from-inside-of-a-function"">don't always use it</a>! It's hard to evaluate because the amount of programming questions we get in a given programming language is heavily dependent on the popularity of the language among askers (mainly CS/programming students), but I don't get the impression that we get, say, more Java (<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/java"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;java&#39;"" rel=""tag"">java</a>) questions than C# (no tag) questions, in proportion with the potential demand. (C# is about as popular as Java on SO, but it's less popular in programming courses, and even more so in CS courses.)</p>

<p>In my experience on Stack Exchange, the argument “there's a tag so this must be on-topic” doesn't come up very often, and when it comes up it's often a post-hoc justification which is obviously invalid if you spend thirty seconds reading the site's scope (e.g. justifying a Windows question on <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/"">Unix &amp; Linux</a> because “there's a [windows] tag” — I wonder how often <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/"">Home Improvement</a> gets questions about the Windows operating system in their [windows] tag). Tags are the last thing an akser types, after the title and the body of the question; how many people do you think abandon their question when they don't see an appropriate tag, as opposed to semi-randomly picking a tag just to get the question through? We get a lot of programming homework questions</p>

<ol>
<li>because the askers are in a <em>computer science</em> curriculum;</li>
<li>because askers come here after getting banned from Stack Overflow for asking too many low-quality questions.</li>
</ol>

<p>The programming language tags serve a purpose: they characterize questions about that language. The semantics of programming languages is a domain of computer science, it is on-topic here. These tags serve a need. Even if they caused some harm, which I dispute, that would not remove our need for them. If people asking off-topic because of the presence of the tag was a widespread phenomenon, we could try renaming <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c</a> to <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/semantics-of-c"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;semantics-of-c&#39;"" rel=""tag"">semantics-of-c</a> or some such, but I think that the phenomenon is so negligible that it isn't worth sacrificing clear tag names.</p>

<p>No, that is never an acceptable title. You should describe the <em>question</em> in the title. The name of an exercise problem, overly generic titles like ""algorithm problem"" or ""dynamic programming"" are <em>useless</em>. If you can not formulate a better title -- one that describes your question shortly but aptly -- you are not ready to post yet.</p>

<li>researching the literature resp. on the internet, and finally</li>
<li><em>describing where you got stuck</em>, that is why the above did not work.</li>

<p>""I don't know how to begin, help?!"" is <em>always</em> a bad question. You want to post something like ""I have tried to set up a dynamic programming recurrence, but I'm not sure about the second case. I think I have to consider X but how do I do that?"".</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I understand that all the forums serve different purposes, and they have their own moderators, rules and policies. But CS seems completely different to me, with respect to all the other forums I have used.</p>

<p>The most significant difference that surprised me is that one will never get a solution. I totally understand that one must do a self-study, and research before posting a question here, but after doing everything one could (in the limited timeframe), he/she will not get a positive reply here. I guess most of the experts that are in the forum have pretty high standards. They will never believe that you have done enough research or self-study until you have proved the problem, in which case you will not need help from a forum or someplace else.</p>

<p>Whenever I have posted homework related question, where I actually have given it some thought, and did my research, but still couldn't managed to solve the problem, I will get a reply that I should think more about it. But, one has to keep in mind, that students take plenty of courses each semester, and nearly all of them will include exercises (which is always helpful to learn the subject more), which amounts to plenty of work. The homeworks will usually have short deadlines (or deadlines that are okay, if you only take one course, and fully focus on the subject). So, it is not possible to devote your full time to just one course, and spend all your time in one problem set, because if you do, you will sacrifice the other subjects. Therefore, each student tries to keep a balance. Plus, not all subjects are equally important to everyone. Everyone thinks about the area where he/she wants to continue or specialize, and spend more time on those topics.</p>

<p>Anyway, what I wanted to say is that, whenever I have a math or programming question, and if I post in MathExchange or StackOverflow, I will get an immediate answer, either a solution or a ""really helpful"" hint for the problem. Then, I can study the problem, see what the person who has answered the solution has done where I was stuck, ask him/her questions regarding the solution to fully grasp it, and at the end better understand the subject, because each problem teaches you something new or a gives a different view of that area. I guess this kind of policy and behavior in those forums, is what makes them very active and helpful.</p>

<p>I understand that it is normal for SO and ME to have plenty of users, after all they serve to a larger base of people than CS. But, when we think that CS is perhaps the most important area of study at the moment, and more and more people enroll to study it, one will expect that the CS forum would be in the level of SO or ME. But seeing the unhelpful replies, I'm not surprised why it is not in the same level as SO or ME.</p>

<h2>We wouldn't be able to handle all the world's homework problems</h2>

<p>Our policies regarding problem dumps exist for a reason.  If we allowed everyone in the world to just post their exercise problem and ask ""I can't see how to solve it, how do I solve this?"", we'd be inundated.  Similarly, if we allowed everyone to post their exercise problem and their proposed solution and ask ""is my solution correct?"", we'd be inundated.  We couldn't handle that kind of traffic, and if we got inundated by that traffic, I suspect it'd be have a dramatic effect on our community.</p>

<p>Your primary beef seems to be that you feel you're too busy with other classes to put in enough effort on your own to satisfy the standards of this community.  I'm sorry to hear that.  But our standards are what they are, for a reason.</p>

<p>Keep in mind: when you come here, you are asking for experts to volunteer their time to help you.  One of the reasons why the site has standards is precisely so that the experts keep coming here.  Be careful what you ask for.  If the site eliminated its standards, it's all too easy to imagine this degenerating into Yahoo Answers or Quora, and you might find that the experts stop coming and you don't get useful answers at all.  There are other sites like that where you can participate, if this community's model doesn't appeal to you.</p>

<p>In particular, if we accepted problem dumps (""here's my homework problem, how do I solve it?""), we'd be inundated with them, and it's not clear whether the core participants would want to be here under those conditions.</p>

<p>And we're not here to be a homework help site, or to build a repository of homework problems and their solutions.  I don't see that as the primary mission this community has decided they want to take on -- at least, not as our primary reason for existence.  We do want to help with concepts, understanding, and problems people face; and if you've put in enough effort to ask a well-crafted, focused, question about some specific aspect or concept you are unclear on, that's in scope as well.</p>

<p>Does that mean we always get the balance right?  I don't know.  Meta is always open for specific proposals about our policies.  And if you keep participating and learning the norms that have built up over time, I imagine you might get a better sense for where these policies come from.</p>

<p>If you're not getting enough personalized assistance with your assignments, you might consider making more use of your teaching assistant or professor at your university.  That's what they are paid for.</p>

<h2>We want to help you, not solve your homework problems for you</h2>

<p>Also, I think I see a common misconception in your post.  I think you are equating ""solving your homework problem for you"" with ""helping you"", and when someone doesn't want to solve your homework problem for you, you decide that they are being unhelpful.  I see this view a lot.  Many students think that if someone who gives them a solution to their homework problem is helping them.  But in my opinion, that's not helping you, even though it might feel like it at the time.</p>

<p>How do you learn to ride a bicycle?  It's not by watching someone else ride one, that's for sure.  The only way to ride a bicycle is by trying to ride it yourself.  You have to struggle with it yourself.  It's a frustrating, annoying struggle at first -- but that's the only way you can learn to be able to do it for yourself.</p>

<p>Homework is like that.  Homework is like teaching yourself to ride the bicycle.  No amount of watching someone else solve your exercise problem for you will substitute for struggling with it yourself.</p>

<h2>Our policies are not that unusual</h2>

<p>Our policies are not actually as unusual as you suggest.  Yes, Math.SE tends to have very different standards.  But you could also compare to CSTheory.SE (Theoretical Computer Science).  There, they have taken an even stronger stance.  Take a look at <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">their help center</a>.  I'll quote a few excerpts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Questions should be based on knowledge sharing, not on shirking</h2>
  
  <p>You should only post questions you're actually seriously thinking about. Users are expected to do their part and try to answer their question by themselves before posting them on cstheory and asking for help from others. Search to see if your question is already answered somewhere else (e.g. Wikipedia) before asking a question. Try to make your question interesting for others by providing some background knowledge. Remember, questions should be based on knowledge sharing, not on shirking. Shirking goes against the spirit of the site.</p>

<h2>We're not the only game in town</h2>

<p>One last suggestion.  You mentioned that you like the Math.SE model better.  I can understand and respect that.  And that raises a natural question:</p>

<p>Why not ask over there, at Math.SE?</p>

<p>They accept many questions about theoretical computer science, and they have over 2000 questions tagged <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/computer-science"">computer science</a>.  It might be an interesting experiment to give it a try and see if you find that community meets your needs better.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong.  I'm not trying to push you away from this site: I do hope you'll stay.  I'm just saying that you could try both Math.CS and here, and compare them.  If you did it systematically, say via a randomized experiment, that might even lead to data that you could point to.  You can't post every question at both places, because cross-posting is forbidden, but you could do a randomized experiment where for the next 10 questions you ask, for each one flipping a coin about where to post.  Who knows; maybe it will work out that the experience there is clearly better all around, and if folks here just saw how it worked out, they'd be persuaded by your arguments.  My experience is that when you want to change a community, hard data can often be extremely influential in changing minds.</p>

Our policy on homework questions is broadly the same as <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Physics</a>, <a href=""https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Chemistry</a>, <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/help/homework"">Biology</a>, <a href=""https://economics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1465/economics-se-policy-on-homework-questions"">Economics</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic"">Stack Overflow</a>. Rather, it's <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Mathematics</a> that's unusual in accepting homework questions with essentially no restriction.</p>

5,"<p>Question's in the title; what makes Computer Science Stack Exchange differ from <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/"">Theoretical Computer Science Stack Exchange</a>?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Theoretical computer science is for mathematicians working in the field of theoretical computer science, at the level of graduate student and upwards. It accepts only research-level questions.</p>

<p>Computer science, in contrast, is for all levels of theoretical computer science, defined somewhat more broadly than in TCS. Many questions here are homework exercises, though some are genuine questions by undergraduates or by working professionals outside academia, or more rarely more basic questions by experts. Some of these questions (both by undergraduates, by professionals, and by post-graduates) are difficult enough to merit asking in TCS.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I agree with David Richerby. Math.se is the anomalous site. It is inundated with boring homework questions that keep repeating in an annual cycle. I personally ran away from the site with disgust, and I wouldn't want the same thing to happen here.</p>

<p>I don't mind giving help, or sometimes complete solutions, for interesting and non-routine exercises. For me they are nice puzzles to sharpen my technical abilities. What I dislike are routine, basic exercises, which I usually only give hints to. This is not merely to discourage such questions, but also to encourage the posters to solve such exercises on their own.</p>

<p>These routine, basic exercises are often not much more than a play with definitions. They are designed to help you learn and internalize these definitions. If a student is unable to solve them, this is usually due to lack of ""mathematical maturity"". The only way to develop mathematical maturity is to solve such exercises enough times until your skill increases.</p>

<p>Another issue that bothers me is fairness. It is common for students to ask for help from their peers, teaching assistants or professors. The latter will help the student with hints, but hopefully not complete solutions, while asking peers might be forbidden. The internet side channel is thus a way of cheating the system. Many people on math.se would disagree with me on this point, which is why that community behaves differently.</p>

<p>There is a hint of entitlement in your question. <em>We are not here to help.</em> We are here to do as we please, forming our community standards through our actions. There is no obligation to help every student in the way he of she seems fit. Our only obligation is to ourselves. There are disagreements among the major users on this site, a plurality of opinions, so even if one person is unwilling to help you, another might. But if all of us as a community feel helping you in this particular way is against our better judgement, your only option is to accept it, and try to change it, for example by asking this question.  </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I share your concern that CS.SE is often not as welcoming to new visitors as it could be. Here's a common scenario: (1) a new visitor asks a question; (2) the question appears to the regulars to be a problem dump; (3) one or more of the regulars posts a copy of a standard comment template like, ""What have you tried; where did you get stuck?""; (4) the question quickly accumulates enough close votes to be placed on hold; (5) end of story: new user leaves, never to return.</p>

<p>I'm more or less okay with stages (1)-(3). It's reasonable to expect that many new users have never read our help section and so don't realize that a question should also include some background about the question, if only to let us know how to target an answer so that it will be of most use. It's also reasonable to expect that many new users haven't taken the time to search other questions to see if there might be one that could be helpful; until our search facility gets much smarter than it currently is, searching old questions is a pain, even for regulars.</p>

<p>My problem with the CS.SE culture is stage (4). My feeling is that we're way too quick to close a question. As I said in a comment recently, we often do something akin to this: a student comes to my office hours and says, ""I can't figure out where to start Question 3 on the homework"". I respond, ""What part specifically are you having trouble with?"" and then without listening to their answers, if any, I kick them out of my office, perhaps saying, ""Look at the text and your notes"". This would be inexcusably unprofessional and my student would have every right to be pissed.</p>

<p>Of course, this analogy is perhaps a bit overstated, but my point, again, is that we're often too quick to pull the close trigger. It would be far better, in my opinion, to downvote a question rather than reflexively cast a close vote. A downvote along with a comment on how to improve the question keeps the lines of communication open for a while. If the question isn't modified after a few days, then an appropriate action would be to close it.</p>

<p>Certainly, some questions are candidates for immediate closure, but not all that many, IMO. Also, I think that the problem of ""driving regulars away"" is a straw man argument. It only takes a few seconds to read a question and decide whether to respond or not, and given the manageable number of questions we get per day (a tiny fraction of, say, Math.SE's), scanning all new questions is a minor burden. A quick downvote is easy, the rep cost is negligible, and it leaves the door open for potential improvement.</p>

<p>(By the way, I noticed that the original question has 9 upvotes and 3 downvotes. Draw your own conclusions.)</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Looking at the activity in Math.SE I'm struck by how many math <em>enthusiasts</em> are there.  It's full of people who just enjoy shifting symbols around to solve problems the way other people enjoy doing crosswords or assembling jigsaw puzzles.  The same is true with regard to stackoverflow and coding.  There's such enthusiasm for coding that there are spinoff code golf and code review SEs.  For some reason answering basic questions about languages, FSMs, etc. just doesn't make the math/CS heart go pitter-pat in the same way.  It's not just the people on cs.SE; as a rule CS questions tend to languish even on math.SE though most such questions are on-topic there.</p>

<p>Find a way to repackage CS questions in a way that tickles that puzzle-solving desire in CS experts, and you'll have your hyperactive CS.SE.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>It happened to me some times. In fact I have to delete certain questions. 
But still my experience is very satisfactory as other questions get responded well.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I mostly ask a lot of questions. In that comparison, I barely answer others. I know thats very very bad. I always feel I know very little about the topic so I almost never look out to answer question. However I am very confident as learn more and more, I will have enough knowledge to answer others and feel confident enough to answer. </p>

<p>Since I ask a lot I feel I have enough experience (of asking questions) to answer this question :p.</p>

<p>About why others may ask you to do more research (my opinions, need not be facts):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The references of CS are more in the form of books unlike programming references which are mostly online articles, knowledgebases and in fact stackoverflow-like QA sites. Now the CS concepts are more rigid and older than programming concepts. </p>

<p>For example, deadlock concept is very well satisfactorily explained in many books (like by author William Stallings or Galvin). So for most concepts you should get your doubts cleared anyway from these books. </p>

<p>Coming to programming side, concepts are relatively newer. Say newly evolved framework in website development or cloud platform. All concepts are more documented and enriched by online community using QA site, knowledge bases and articles. And by the same habit they occur to answer you more. They have to because it more likely that your doubt reveal certain untouched aspect of certain new framework which can barely be found highlighted in any book.</p>

<p>Also many programming concepts (like behavior of a particular overload of a method, or use of particular method to achieve something different, for example <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1767034/1317018"">here</a>, op proposes to use groovy's <code>find{}</code> closure to emulate terminating loop, which I use now frequently) too detailed / subtle for books to document them all. In contrast, CS concepts are straight forward and do not involve intricate details.</p></li>
<li><p>Why you get more answers on Maths than CS? Well because Math is by nature, a subject of problem solving. Well you may argue whether CS is not a subject of problem solving? Or programming is not a subject of problem solving? Thats not like that. They are too subjects of problem solving. But both CS and programming are new fields relatively to Maths. <em>Maths is ancient. CS and programming are modern.</em> Both programming and CS find their roots in Maths. Since long, humans love to solve mathematical problems. Mathematical problems are not only heavily documented but also thoroughly practiced for many centuries. There were always competitions like Math Olympiads when there was no programming competitions. I also have a friend who is always in search of new type of mathematical problems to solve. Thats why even after heavily documented, like CS topics, ops on Maths forum are always crazy to solve your problem. Well on CS site too, there are crazy people who love to answer your question. But they are certainly less in number in comparison to Maths site. I feel this is more cumulative psychological effect caused due to culture that is there around the approaches taken towards learning these two subjects. That is also a reason why your Maths homework problem is more welcome than CS homework problem. Obviously I feel over time as number of problems in CS are more and more talked / discussed online, this difference will vanish and more people here will also go crazy to answer you. </p></li>

<p>On Programmers, we have a <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">pretty comprehensive ""what topics can I ask about"" page in our Help Center</a>. Where possible, and we like to link to the /help/on-topic page of other SE sites that may be helpful to people. Where not, we like to link to an appropriate Meta.SE or Meta.Programmers post explaining why a particular topic isn't appropriate for Programmers. You do something similar on your /help/on-topic page.</p>

<p>Does Computer Science want a link to your site's /help/on-topic page, similar to how we link to Stack Overflow and The Workplace? If you do, what should the text say (it should be short and simple, with more info available in your /help/on-topic page)?</p>

People who take the time to read the description of the site, or a referral from another site, won't ask such problematic questions.</p>

<p>Conversely, as a professional programmer, I encourage programmers to pay attention to the science behind their craft. Understanding algorithms, formal specifications, programming language design, etc. rather than operating by rote definitely makes one a better programmer. When you have a computer science question, don't be shy: ask it on the computer science site.</p>

<p>One thing I have been agonising over is this: how to represent computer science visually? At all and, more importantly in this context, in a small square-ish form factor? Can we avoid clichés?</p>

<p>So this is a request to brainstorm, break down CS as you see it to its essentials and boil it down to abstract, visual cues. Go as far as you can: while mockups are great, I guess that the designers can do a lot (maybe more) with ideas and concepts. A handful of keywords may be enough; see <a href=""https://crypto.meta.stackexchange.com/q/637"">here</a> for the thoughts behind the logo of crypto.SE.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/44552"">Paweł</a>, a designer working for Stack Exchange, is <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/26663338#26663338"">seeking ideas</a>, especially about a logo.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>From my perspective, computer science (as an academic field) embodies two concepts maybe more than any other, and does so maybe more than any other discipline: problem-solving by <em>reduction</em> and <em>abstraction</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Reduction</strong> is about breaking apart a problem, identifying easier subproblems (maybe but not necessarily recursive) whose solutions can be combined or translated into a solution of the original problem.<br>
The concept is pervasive from software engineering (modularisation of systems) all the way to TCS (reduction as an algorithm design principles; creating structure in problem classes by reduction techniques).</p>

<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is about generalising a given problem by relaxing or creating parameters, switching to application-independent terminology, and maybe ignoring some constraints for the moment. Then, solve the resulting, more abstract problem and use the insight gained to solve the original one.<br>
This also happens everywhere in CS, from general-purpose programming libraries to algorithm design principles.</p>

<hr>

<p>How may this look like visually? I note that the two concepts are somewhat dual to each other. One narrows, the other broadens scope. Hence, I think complementary triangles may work nicely.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8q0iN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8q0iN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The inscribed triangle (left) displays one triangle for abstraction (orange, inner) and one for reduction (blue, outer) reading from bottom to top; the image works the other way around as well. It is a clean design I'd expect to work well (visually) in most circumstances. The four resulting areas highlight the plurality of CS as well.</p>

<p>The overlapping triangles (middle and right) work from the same basic idea but represent both concepts equally large. In addition to plurality, we now have distinct parts (only blue or orange) but also an overlapping part (both colors) which represents that there is a common core in CS, despite some fields being very far apart from each other in terms of methodology.</p>

<p>Colors are left for the designers to pick, obviously (I happen to like the blue-orange combination, personally). The overlap diamond should probably have proper color mixing going on.</p>

<p>This has partially been inspired by the very simple yet fitting logo of crypto.SE; read the <a href=""https://crypto.meta.stackexchange.com/q/637"">designer's thought process here</a>.</p>

<p>That said, there have been <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/tools/question-close-stats"">94 questions</a> closed with the custom reason pointing to Stack Overflow. Since these were not migrated, we can't actually know how many would have been rejected, however. (Migrating them now would very likely require checking that those questions have not already been reposted. The close reasons suggest this is somewhat common.) Without knowing the rejection rate, we can't estimate how many of those questions would have been productively migrated. </p>

<p>Of course the whole reason for establishing a default path is to make migration easier. As long the path of least resistance is the custom close reason, I suspect migrating from CS to SO will be rather rare. That's not a bad outcome, in my opinion. For people new to the network, having your question migrated to a whole 'nother site can be confusing and frustrating. And, of course, new users are the most likely to misunderstand the scope of the sites. </p>

<p>If there's a reasonable edit and/or an interesting answer, go for it.<br>

is justified.</p></li>
<li><p>""Questions for which the answer is apparently outside the expertise of everyone here or just too much work.""</p>

<p>If it's offtopic, close as such. Otherwise, edit to make it answerable if possible. If not, just leave it be. Maybe add a bounty if you think it should be possible to get an answer.</p></li>

<p>Every one of the actions you can take requires further community action: voting, commenting or re-reading and answering. Thus, it is good that questions that have been acted upon in a meaningful way get bumped up.
No hesitation there.</p>

<p>Of course, keeping the volume so that revisited question don't drown new ones is a good idea. You can prepare your edits or answers locally (Markdown in files, or using stackedit.io) and then spread the actual actions out over time (each should not take long). I think five to ten bumping actions per day (plus close votes which only bump the review queue) is a good range to hit.</p>

5,"<p><a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/26686948#26686948"">Chatting</a> with designer Paweł, the idea of using the theme of <em>connection</em> resp. CS as an enabler for connection has come up.</p>

<ul>
<li>Computer science as a discipline combines/connects mathematics, electrical/computer engineering, and social sciences. The disciplines change depending on whom you ask, but it's usually more than two.</li>
<li>Technology that uses CS principlies connects people, things, and people with things.</li>
<li>CS enables interdisciplinary research/work all over the spectrum; it connects <em>fields/disciplines</em>.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>One idea to represent this (due to Paweł) is as some form of Venn diagram (which happened incidentally <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1170/98"">with my other attempt</a>). Maybe like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9RSlc.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9RSlc.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I think it's far enough away from how Venn diagrams usually look to avoid cliché (by showing only the ""center part"") but communicates the idea.<br>
Again, please excuse my poor choice of color and poor-man's opacity-based color mixing. I'm sure the geometry (who says sets have to be circles?) can be tweaked, too; the two-color regions seem a bit too large. Also, there is room to improve the ""outside form""; a square is boring.</p>

<p>Another idea (mine) is slightly less abstract: ""cables"" from different origins and of different kinds plugging into a common core. Mockup:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hBKJM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hBKJM.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I'm using a triangle because squares are boring and higher-order polygons seem to be too much. On second thought, a square stood on one vertex (rhombus/diamond) might work nicely. Colors and plug shapes just to indicate variety.</p>

<p>You can find plenty of applications of rooted trees e.g. in the context of algorithms and data structures, automata theory, computational complexity theory, computational geometry, programming language theory, formal methods, artificial intelligence, computer architecture, computer graphics, parallel and distributed computing, information storage and retrieval, and software engineering.</p>

5,"<p>My name is Paweł, I’m a product designer at Stack Exchange. I’m super happy for you, because the process of graduation is about to be concluded! Congratulations to all of you!</p>

<h1>New Design</h1>

<p>The new design comes with a few perks. It will give you your own unique theme that reflects your topic, culture &amp; community. This will help brand your site as unique, even while you share common elements with other sites that show you are part of a bigger Stack Exchange family.</p>

<h2>Design Concept</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wnP8t.png"" alt=""Pattern""></p>

<p>This was one of the toughest site designs to create for me. Why? It was very hard for me to define what Computer Science is and, what is more important, what this site is about. It's not that easy to design something without knowing essence of the topic. It took me long time to understand (better) what Computer Science is and what kind of problems do you all solve on this site.</p>

<p>My first thought was ""Let's go with some computer icon and we're good"". Well, that was dumb and I don't have to explain why... Then I came up with <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/pywgtf6.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bulb with 1s and 0s</a>. Because I thought that Computer Science is about 1s and 0s. About TRUE vs FALSE. About Inputs &amp; Outputs. But I was wrong. It was a cliché. Some of you explained me that very well on <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2710/conversation/logo"">your chat</a> (<strong>thank you for that and for all collaboration!</strong>).</p>

<p>So yes, I was trying to better understand Computer Science and, thanks to your Community, I discovered it’s hard to explain. It's not only about PCs and programming; the definition is more abstract. I realized that computer science is mix of other different fields. For some of you it's a mix of math, computers &amp; physics. For some of you it's a mix of hacking, math, statistics and machines learning. So the definition of CS was dependent on whom I asked. </p>

<p>The idea was simple: create something that fits Your Community - the community of extremely intelligent and diverse people. I was very impressed reading some of the questions and answers on your site. Knowledge you have on different fields and aspects is astonishing. Honestly - it was super hard to create a design for this topic, but thanks to your community my task became much easier. <strong>Thank you again for that!</strong></p>

<p>So here's what this logo is about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Connection - CS has something in common with many fields. It connects Math with Physics. It connects Machine Learning with real life. CS is used in biomechanics, biology and many other fields.</li>
<li>Abstract thinking - I found out that you treat Computer Science in a very abstract way trying to think out-of-the-box. I think this is huge value of your community.</li>
<li>Rooted trees - something that one of your users came up with (<a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1186/44552"">stolen idea</a> :)). </li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of days ago I came up with some different logo. But after I saw this proposal I thought to myself ""<em>It's perfect</em>"". I got rid of my initial concept and used your community proposal (tweaking it slightly). Why? Well, it represents all the ideas I've had in my mind. It's also way simpler than what I was thinking about. <strong>But what's most important - it's your proposal, basically you made this design and you came up with the idea (I've just moved few pixels around)</strong>. And that's what makes it so special in my opinion.</p>

<p>So here it is!</p>

<h2>Color Scheme</h2>

5,"<p>Some thoughts.</p>

<h3>Forms</h3>

<p>I like the background. It's abstract yet aesthetic (I guess 70's wallpapers are back?). I for one can believe to see remnants of a (very complicated) Venn diagram, which I appreciate.</p>

<p>The logo I like for all the reasons stated over at Jukka's proposal. It's clean, it's iconic, it's CS, and it symbolizes many qualities of CS. The gaps add a nice touch.<br>
(There's this part of me that wants the logo to be symmetric, but I know that guy's got problems. ;) )</p>

<p>I appreciate that ""science"" is lettered more strongly than ""computer"" <strong>very much</strong>. Great idea.</p>

<p>The logo font is ... very ordinary. I do not actively dislike, but it also does not add anything to the design.</p>

<h3>Colors</h3>

<p>I'm not the biggest fan of cyan (I think I'd prefer more blue, less green), but that's a matter of taste. The combination of colors is pleasing.</p>

<p>The color ""impression"" is very different from SO and programmers.SE, so that is a plus. Among the science sites, only biology.SE comes close and I think there's no confusion between us and them. In other words, recognizability is given -- great!</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>

<p>The details will have to be checked when it's live (the accepted-green seems a bit bright). That you designers have not yet made tech build a shareable live-preview for you guys is puzzling! </p>

<p>One thing: centered question titles are really awkward.</p>

<p>Second thing: the number of answers is smaller than the number of votes and views, so alignment looks really weird (esp. the third question in the screenshot).</p>

<h3>Fonts</h3>

<p>The main text font looks fine to me. I'll have to ""use"" it for a while to form an opinion about readability.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind how it works together with MathJax, which most of our posts use. Apparently, <a href=""https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/6790/56876"">mistakes were made on physics.SE</a> on that front, something we probably don't want to repeat.<br>
I'm not saying that the proposed font does not work well with (the default font of) MathJax -- it's definitely not as bad as the screenshot on meta.physics.SE! -- but it's hard to say much from the given sample. Maybe some consulting with an expert in that area is in order (if it did not happen already). (A quick googling got me <a href=""https://www.peterkrautzberger.org/0183/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>.) Just trying to say that the pairing of fonts is something to be aware of.</p>

<p>I'm torn about the use of a proportional font for tags. I think a serif font would work well or better for our site since ""teletype"" is associated with code to some extent; on the other hand, it can be a tip of the hat towards our more applied parts. More opinions from the community are needed, imho.</p>

<h3>Badge icons</h3>

<p>I can not quite tell what they are supposed to be; a circle with a hole is not very specific. The nodes from the logo? Well, okay. I guess they are not something I have strong negative feelings about, and I don't have a better idea right now, but I feel like there may be something better out there, in the vague cloud of ideas.</p>

<p>Okay, one idea: take up the tree metaphor in that gold badges are root nodes, silver badges inner nodes, and bronze badges are leaves.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sDsBB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sDsBB.png"" alt=""mockup for badges""></a></p>

<p>I think I drew the lines too long; they should probably be only stubs, hinting at the edges.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>Thank you for caring. Thank you for asking. Thank you for listening.</p>

<p>This can not be stressed enough in my estimation. I had daymares about this thread popping up out of nowhere with a horrible cliché thing (before you visited our chat). You made a simple mod very happy. Thank you!</p>

<p>And, of course, thanks for the good work. I hope there will be broad approval in the community so that we/you can move on!</p>

5,"<p>Thank you very much for your efforts. I'm so excited the site has reached this phase!</p>

<p>I feel like such a spoil-sport for posting this, but despite working with graphs/trees daily, upon first seeing the logo my association was with chemistry or physics. It looks a bit like an atomic model, like the <a href=""http://images.opt.be/images/elto_big/17257_1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Atomium building</a> in Belgium, perhaps even like a <a href=""http://www.organicchem.org/oc1web/exp/lp/dis.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">distillation apparatus</a>. Upon seeing the logo, I just can't get these images out of my head.</p>

<p>Even though I really like the logo, is there any way it can be made more tree-y? Perhaps a concentric circle can be cut out of one or two of the nodes, indicating some information is stored there (e.g. red-black tree). That might make the logo too complicated, though.</p>

<p>That said, I'd be totally fine with the current logo, just sharing my thoughts.</p>

And even though I made a sample ad for you guys with the rest of the sample ads, somehow the thread itself didn't get posted. Weird how that works. Anyway, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!</p>

<p>Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>relevant blogs and websites about computer science</li>
<li>computer science, events, conferences, or meetups</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be <strong>300 x 250 pixels</strong>, or double that if using high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of <strong>150 KB</strong></li>
<li><strong>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px (2px for high DPI) border surrounding it.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1195"">here</a>.</p>

5,"<h3>References</h3>

<p><em>Rule of thumb:</em> Provide references so that the work is uniquely identified and easily accessible for readers (in case of online resources).</p>

<p><strong>Academic resources</strong></p>

<p>References to books or papers should consist of more than a link or a book name. Not only do links break eventually, they also require a click; the reference should be clear as is. This means that title, authors and year should be stated. If available, a link to an online version is great; use DOI if at all possible (such links survive moving resources).</p>

<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">Google Scholar</a> is a great help for finding meta data and free copies of articles.</p>

<p>As for formatting, I like to use a style emulating articles:</p>

<p>For books, you should include at least title and authors (year published and edition would be helpful).  For papers, you generally should include at least title, authors, and where it was published (e.g., conference name and year; or journal name, volume, and number).</p>

<p><strong>Online resources</strong></p>

<p>Cite with author, URL (prefer permalinks) and date of last access. You can use above scheme, or go inline like this:</p>

<p>If the website offers revisions (e.g. Wikipedia) you may want to link to the exact revision you are referencing. This is essential if you are asking about unclarities or suspected mistakes in the material, which will hopefully be fixed in the future and thus leave your question meaningless (unless you included the relevant passage as a quote, in which case a link to the revision is still a good idea).</p>

<p>Many sites have voting buttons that complement the overall site identity.  Some notable examples are Academia, Arquade, and Christianity.  I feel site identity would be strengthened by slightly altering the voting buttons (without going overboard) to match the theme of trees and nodes.  If you feel it won't be confusing, you can try something like this:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EXk9Y.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EXk9Y.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>Titles should not be centered on the page or be bolded.  The color should be slightly darkened and desaturated so they match the question.  When I first saw the question title it was not immediately obvious that it was associated with the question.</p>
<h3>Badges</h3>
<p>Decide what they are and make it obvious.  Right now they look like the radio buttons:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Awi3cm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Awi3cm.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Continue with the trees/nodes identity as long as it's obvious, or to something else completely.  Radio buttons don't particularly communicate &quot;computer science.&quot;</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>In general the main logo, colors, and design look clean and professional.  Good job.</p>

<hr>

<p>Whe we discussed the beta-version of our new design, <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1190/98"">I proposed</a> to use the tree idea for badges as well. Badges should be nodes: gold badges are roots, silver badges inner nodes, bronze badges leaves.</p>

<p>Paweł ran with that. Zoomed in, these are the current badge icons:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gwQJT.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gwQJT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>For me, the metaphor does not work: I see control nobs rather than tree nodes: bronze is more ""tuned up"" than gold. Also, silver just visually looks like ""more"" than gold.</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you have other ideas?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>My second concern, the gold looking like ""less"" than the silver could be addressed by given the root more edges:</p>

<p>Now they have equally many edges, and gold clearly is the root.</p>

<p>(I left the stub lengths longer than I prefer, because another answer deals with that. This is about the number of stubs on the gold badge.)</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The control-knob impression may be caused by the arrow shape of the edge stubs.
Here's a crude mockup of a rounder stub of different lengths:</p>

<p>I think I may like the shortest stubs (v-2) the most. v1 and longer, I don't like so much.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>We could also go one step further as <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1220/98"">in my other answer</a>, leave the tree metaphor behind and make the gold badge a ""central"" node in an implied graph:</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>One of the main purposes of meta is to have discussion.
The rules about comments not being for discussion do not apply to meta
as you can see by visiting e.g. MSO.
However some of our moderators feel that 
it is fine to remove comments on meta as they please and 
do so quite aggressively.
This is not something I have seen on other SE sites that I participate
(cstheory, MathOverflow, Math.SE, SO, etc.).</p>

<p>I don't see why comments on meta posts 
that are not causing any trouble should be removed.
There is no harm in letting them stay where they are.</p>

<p>According to the SE's moderation policy
the main point of having community moderators is to have exception handlers 
in cases where community cannot handle, 
not janitors.
I think it is rather unfortunate
if a moderator feels that he has a right or duty
to remove harmless comments based on his personal preferences.
This seems a clear overuse of moderator powers 
to make the meta look like as he pleases and
I see it as a sign that the moderator is 
taking the usage of moderator powers lightly.</p>

<p>What do you think?
Should moderators use their moderator powers
when there is no real need for using moderator powers,
particularly on meta?
E.g. should they remove relevant and 
completely fine comments giving feedback to OP 
just because they please, as in 
<a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1211/new-site-design"">here</a>?</p>

5,"<p>The answer to your titular question is <strong>no</strong>, but you are not really asking this question.</p>

<p><em>Tl;dr:</em> Your complaint is based on a strawman. I reject it.</p>

<hr>

<p>You first complained about this <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1192/98"">here</a>. </p>

<p>In that entire thread, I removed a total of <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/k2hwK"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>two</em> comments</a> (besides some I wrote myself). Both because they were obsolete, one by other comments by the same user, the other (yours) by an answer (your own).</p>

<hr>

<p>So, <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1211/new-site-design"">this thread</a>. Here I removed a <a href=""https://imgur.com/Cquyr70"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">greater number of comments</a> -- again because they were obsolete.</p>

<p>The OP specifically requested (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you see any CSS/styling bugs, please <strong>start a new post</strong> and tag it with ""design"" and ""bug"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It quickly became clear from a whole slew of comments that the title alignment was more widely disliked, so <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1214/what-should-be-the-alignment-of-titles"">I created a new post</a>. That made all comments about alignment obsolete -- both their content <em>and</em> their number/popularity, since the new thread was designed for voting. I removed those and some chat-style comments between the OP and myself in which we discussed how to proceed (also obsolete).<br>
FWIW, I was complete transparent about that.</p>

<p><em>Nota bene:</em> Before I took action, that question had amassed over 20 comments.</p>

<p><sup><em>PS:</em> All the comments I removed agreed with my own sentiment. Not that I cared, but the insinuation that I would use my mod powers to control opinion is insulting.</sup></p>

<hr>

<p>For reference, there <em>is</em> of course a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/237978/156248"">network-wide policy for dealing with comments</a>. It clearly states that obsolete comments should be removed (contrary to what Kaveh claims). </p>

<p>It remains open if I had to remove them as promptly as I did -- the policy uses phrases like ""long ago"" for their examples -- but the basic reasons for deletion were fulfilled. As a user, I would have flagged ""obsolete""; I can not to that as a mod without deleting immediately, so that's what happened. </p>

<hr>

<p>I stand by removing obsolete comments. It keeps comment threads -- even discussions -- readable. I <em>do</em> delete less aggressively on meta than on the main site, for exactly the reasons you mention. (In discussions, comments rarely become truly obsolete.) </p>

<p>So, in summary, I reject this complaint as invalid.</p>

<p>I may adjust my ""pain threshold"" in the future and withhold cleanups until the dust has settled (read: nobody will notice) in the future. However, I doubt I will ever see reason <em>not</em> to delete excessive chatting and/or huge numbers of obsolete comments, even if they are relatively new.</p>

<p><sup><em>PS:</em> 
The fact that you (Kaveh) have no way to know exactly what comments got removed but your own (a small number, none of which were controversial in any way) makes this complaint even more shaky.</sup></p>

<hr>

<p>FWIW, some stats (the other mods can verify that I don't make these numbers up):</p>

<ul>
<li>I deleted a total twenty (20) comments on meta this year. 19 of them are discussed above. A sizable portion of them was my own.</li>
<li><p>Since the beginning of this site (almost four years ago), I deleted a total of 79 comments on meta. I have no (easy) way of knowing which and by whom, and I don't know if comments on deleted posts count.</p>

<p>I see that I dealt with 36 flags (some of which probably comment flags) and cleanups usually involve at about 50% my own comments, though.</p></li>
<li>For reference, I have removed 204 comments on the main site this year (to my surprise, I'm this is the least number among all mods!), and 2.8k total.</li>

<p>I would like to re-open, and I want to put a bounty for it. Thanks.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Sorry to see the negative reaction your question got.  I will say that I view the question a bit differently than others here.  Given the clarification that you are looking for an algorithm, not an implementation, I think the question is on-topic and suitable for this site.</p>

<p>And thank you for responding to the feedback by editing the question.  That was exactly the right thing to do.</p>

<p>However, your edit introduces a new issue with the question.  The original question was asking: ""how do I enumerate all MAX^SIZE values?""  That I think is a reasonable question, and one that can be answered algorithmically.  But your latest edit makes clear that you already know a solution to that question; you already know of an algorithm to do this.  After the latest edit, it sounds like your question has changed and become: ""can I call my algorithm brute force?  and, is there a better way?""</p>

<p>These two questions, I feel, are problematic:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>""Can I call my algorithm brute force?"" does not strike me as a question that's a very good fit here, as it sounds like it might be a matter of opinion what counts as a brute force, and the answer might well depend on other information you haven't given us (about what you're going to use this algorithm for).  Also, it's not clear how you're going to use answers (how is the answer going to change what you do with this?), and it doesn't seem likely to be useful to anyone in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>""Is there a better way?"" is a bit problematic because you haven't defined what would qualify as ""better"", and ""better"" might be a matter of opinion.  You could improve that question by giving a metric for how you want to evaluate answers (e.g., asking ""Is there another algorithm whose asymptotic running time is asymptotically lower?"").</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, I recommend that you do one of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Option 1: Stick with the original question, ""how do I enumerate all MAX^SIZE values?""  Edit the question to ask that, and to remove your solution and the other questions.  (If the question is re-opened, you can then post your solution as an answer.)</p></li>
<li><p>Option 2: Edit the question to remove ""Can I call my algorithm brute force?"", and focus on ""Is there a better way?"" -- but ask a more specific question, by removing ""better"" and instead asking if there is an algorithm that is faster/simpler/uses less space/whatever.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you did either of those two things, I imagine that I'd be inclined to vote to re-open it (and I don't think you'd need a bounty to get a useful answer).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can leave it as is, and leave it to the community to vote on whether to close or re-open it.  Personally, I don't recommend this option, for the reasons I articulated above, but it is your choice.</p>

<p>Finally -- thank you for asking here on Meta about how to improve your question.  That was constructive.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>One problem with your original question is switching between notations of <em>X</em>, <code>x</code>, x - for unlike things (scalar &lt;-> array).</p>

<p><em>My</em> next problem with the question is the, hm, <em>type designator</em> <code>int</code> in <code>for (int x = {1,1,..1} ; …</code> - <code>int</code>s do not take on composite values.</p>

<p>I can't figure out for sure</p>

<ul>
<li>whether you are asking about one-dimensional arrays or multi-dimensional ones<br>
(one dimensional, more likely than not)</li>
<li>whether you are asking about <em>notation</em>  or <em>algorithm</em><br>
(I <em>noticed</em> your <em>no</em>, but there is <em>in a similar way</em>. With a one-dimensional array, I'm another one not seeing <em>algorithm</em>: just iterate over all values - trivial for the likes of <code>int</code>, <em>difficult</em> for irrational numbers.)</li>
<li>whether the number of dimensions of <em>X</em> is known at the point of iteration</li>
</ul>

<p>Not every <em>traversal</em> is a <em>search</em> - if yours <em>is</em> a search, please mention <em>why</em> all values/elements shall be evaluated.<br>
If you ""operate on the leaves, only"", what would be the difference between breadth- and depth-first traversals? If it doesn't matter, I don't see the advantage of thinking/arguing about it that way, even if the implementation looks the type.</p>

<p>Evaluating every  possible value/element is <em>brute force</em> in my book. Calling it that is pointless if there <em>obviously</em> (CS: provably) is no alternative.</p>

<p>Presenting ideas in a notation with documented interpretation should make interpretation less prone to divergence. This <em>not</em> being CS, chose a language/notation and present what you are trying to achieve (with comments in case of programming language code). Have a look at python's itertools. Provide more context!</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Fundamentally, algorithms and programs are the same thing, except that algorithms tend to be expressed more abstractly, e.g., in pseudocode. Thus, one can regard any programming question as a request for an algorithm, which is to be expressed in a particular language.</p>

<p>As such, ""algorithms questions"" versus ""programming questions"" isn't black and white.  There are shades of grey.</p>

<p>I do feel, though, that some algorithms are so basic that they are just programming tasks.  For example, if somebody asks for an algorithm to compute the total of the numbers in some array, then, sure, there's an ""algorithm"" to do that. However, it's so simple that, in quite a strong sense, ""Sum the values in the array"" <em>is</em> the algorithm, rather than</p>

<pre><code>total := 0
for each i in [1..length]
    total := total + A[i]
</code></pre>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, with something like the AKS primality algorithm, you'd expect the process to be broken down into a number of smaller steps, each of which is much more basic than ""Check if <code>n</code> is prime.""</p>

<p>To me, the question we're discussing here (looping through all possible values that an array could take) is at the more basic end of this range. I agree that, it's more complicated than ""sum the elements of the array"" but it's the sort of thing I'd expect a programmer to be able to implement without needing detailed descriptions of how.  So, to me, it's a programming question, rather than an algorithms question.</p>

<p>However, I accept that this is a completely subjective judgement.  I see there's a reopen vote in progress and people seem to think the question should be reopened. I disagree but I'm not going to vote against, since I've already had my say and my feeling is ""This question isn't quite right for the site"", and not ""This question is bad and must be closed.""</p>

5,"<p>The general rule is: don't edit questions in a way that would invalidate answers that were correct at the time.</p>

<p>If all existing answers are incorrect or incomplete, we get into a gray area. On the one hand, we don't want to flood the site with duplicate questions just because they didn't get a good answer the first time round. On the other hand, if your question was systematically misunderstood or if you've realized you didn't express it clearly, it may be better to edit the question to match the existing answers, and ask a new question that covers what you really meant to ask.</p>

<p>If you realize after the fact that the question you asked was not the question you meant to ask, then, unless the question is unanswered, do ask a new question.</p>

<p>I think your case falls into the grey area. If you can find a significant difference between what the answers cover and what you want to know, then I encourage you to post a new question, linking to the old one and clearly explaining how the questions differ. On the other hand, if the problem is merely that your question hasn't had good enough answers, then all I can do is encourage you to give it some time (you don't have to mark any answer as accepted if no answer fully answers the question); you may try to hurry things up by offering a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/bounty"">bounty</a> (but keep in mind that bounties don't guarantee good answers).</p>

<p>Given current tools, all I can say is that if you notice that an answer of yours has been deleted because the asker deleted their question, and that answer has lasting value, please flag it and moderators will undelete. (On the other hand, if the question is deleted while you were writing an answer, please repost the question in your name if you want, askers are free to delete their question, it's deleting someone else's answer as a side effect that's iffy.)</p>

<p>I do say <em>if the answer has lasting value</em>. Askers can delete their question if it is unanswered, or if it has a single answer with no upvote. The intent is to allow askers to delete questions where the answer is “you have a typo” or “you misread the problem statement”, which do not result in any teachable moment. Similarly I don't consider something like a straightforward calculation or a definition copied from a reference to be an answer with lasting value. On the other hand, if your answer can be useful to people other than the asker (and other than students doing the exact same homework assignment), I think it should be kept.</p>

<p>I'm proposing to make this a moderator policy: if a moderator notices a self-deleted question with an answer that has lasting value according to the guidelines above, then they will undelete the thread.

For instance, ""how do I write assembly code for memcpy(), in the Mano assembly language?"" would be off-topic, as that's a coding question that calls for us to write code targeted at Mano assembly.  Same for MIX, or MIPS, or x86, or any other assembly language, regardless of whether the underlying platform is real or theoretical.</p>

<p>Why?  I don't see much difference between ""write me code to do X, in MIPS assembly"" vs ""write me code to do X, in Mano assembly"" vs ""write me code to do X, in MIX"".  The first of those three is already established as off-topic.  I suggest that the other two are essentially equivalent and should also be off-topic.  Askers could be directed to Stack Overflow for those sorts of questions.</p>

<p>I have no position on whether conceptual questions <em>about</em> a theoretical architecture/platform should be on-topic or off-topic.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I think this is a difficult tricky issue. Here is my far from perfect two cents:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the question about understanding an aspect of the model or is it a program to be used?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it is a question whose intention is to understand an aspect of the model then I think it is fine. I think the same idea can apply to questions about MIX/MMIX, Z80, DFA, NFA, PDA, and other models and even common programming languages.</p>

<p>Another criteria that we can take into account is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If posted on Stack Overflow would it get answered?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If yes then there is less harm in closing the question and directing the user to ask it on Stack Overflow or simply migrating the question there.</p>

<hr>

<p>The main issue which I agree with (if I understand it correctly) is that we do not want to duplicate Stack Overflow.
On the other hand there is a concern that we would ban questions which are computer science questions and would not get a good answer on Stack Overflow. </p>

<p>It is far better that he gave source of the problem instead of trying to hide it.

<p>With edit and your answer, which shows what problem is behind the task is more like win-win-win (question is proper, author learns something, we do not fully destroy the contest).</p>

<p>Please answer this question with <strong><em>students asking homework questions</em></strong> in mind.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<h2>Ask questions about concepts, not about your exercise</h2>

<p>Don't ask us about how to solve your homework exercise.  Instead, spend some time trying to solve the homework exercise, and use that to figure out where you have a conceptual gap in your understanding.</p>

<p>Then, ask about the concept you don't quite understand yet.</p>

<p>If you've done a good job of this, often your question won't even mention your homework exercise at all.  Yes, you'll start with your exercise, and you'll try to solve it, and you'll get stuck -- but then you should use that experience to try to generalize.  Perhaps you might ask about how to solve a particular type of task (e.g., how do I prove a language is regular?  how do I check whether an algorithm is correct?).  </p>

<h2>Make your question useful to others</h2>

<p>A significant part of our mission is to build an archive of high-quality questions and answers that are likely to be helpful to others.  Asking how to solve your specific homework exercise is unlikely to be useful to others (as they're unlikely to have the exact same exercise as you, or to be stuck at exactly the same point).</p>

<p>However, if you can ask a conceptual question that gets at a theme or type of task or conceptual confusion that many people studying the same material are likely to have, then it's more likely that your question will be useful to others.</p>

<h2>But why can't I just post my homework exercise and ask for help?</h2>

<p>The purpose of homework exercises are (1) to give you practice, and (2) to help you self-diagnose gaps in your understanding.  Therefore, asking us to solve your homework question is almost never a good idea -- it doesn't serve either of those purposes, and is likely to waste your time and ours.</p>

<p>We're not a homework help site.  Instead, we're here to get specific <em>conceptual computer science questions</em> answered, and to build an archive of knowledge.  Make sure your question fits that purpose.</p>

<p>That said, if you can't figure out how to turn your problem into a broader conceptual question and want to ask about your exercise, here is the formula for what you must do:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Try to solve it before asking here.</strong> Spend a significant amount of time trying to solve it on your own, before posting here.  Think hard for several hours.  Try simplified versions of the problem to see if you can solve them.  Try searching for similar problems here to see what you can learn from them.  Don't post here until you've exhausted all available options.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Show your work so far.</strong> Tell us in the question what approaches you've tried and where you got stuck.  Show us what progress you've made so far.  Are you asking an algorithms question?  Tell us what algorithm design paradigms you've tried (e.g., greedy, dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, etc.), and where you got stuck with each one.  Show us the best algorithm you were able to find so far, even if it's less efficient than you're looking for.  This helps us write answers that are more likely to be useful to you, and helps us avoid wasting time trying something you already tried.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask about the specific concept that gives you trouble.</strong> We expect you to do the work of narrowing down the problem to the particular concept that's giving you trouble, and ask about that specifically.  Don't just post your exercise and force us to infer what concept you're struggling with; you should do that part of the work, and then ask a question about the concept you're unclear on.  This will yield a question that's more likely to be useful to others in the future.  As a side effect, it shows that you're not just trying to get us to do your work for you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask about a specific aspect of the problem that you're struggling with.</strong> If you can't figure out how to identify a concept that you're unclear on, articulate a specific question <em>about</em> some specific aspect of the exercise.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>BAD: ""Here's my exercise, how do I solve it?""</p></li>
<li><p>GOOD: ""I came up with the following algorithm and it seems to work on all examples of size $\le 5$, but I'm not sure how to prove it correct -- what are some techniques for that?""</p></li>
<li><p>BAD: ""Here's my exercise, I just want a hint.  Can anyone give me a hint?""</p></li>
<li><p>GOOD: ""I came up with an algorithm for the exercise, but my instructor requires me to prove it terminates.  What are some techniques for proving that an algorithm will terminate?""</p></li>
<li><p>GOOD: ""I wrote a candidate proof of correctness.  However, I'm not sure whether step 5 is valid: if $p$ is a shortest path from $s$ to $t$, can I assume that it doesn't contain any cycles?""</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Credit the source.</strong> Reference the source of the exercise.  If it's an exercise from a textbook, include the title and author of the book and the problem number, so that someone trying to answer the question can go look it up themselves if htey need to.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>But my exercise isn't homework!</h2>

<p>Actually, we don't care whether the exercise was assigned to you as homework or not.  We may sometimes call your problem a ""homework problem"", but that is a shortcut.  This policy applies whenever you ask an exercise-style problem (one designed to help you learn the material), regardless of whether it is part of a course or not, or whether it was assigned as homework, or if you're just trying it on your own.</p>

<h2>Why won't you just show me the answer to the exercise? It's probably easy for you!</h2>

<p>As explained on <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/a/571/14578"">Math.SE</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Providing an answer that doesn't help a student learn is not in the student's own best interest, and if a solution complete enough to be copied verbatim and handed in is given immediately, it will encourage more people to use the site as a free homework service. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, as the adage says: ""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"".  Giving someone the answer to their exercise is giving them a fish; it might seem helpful on first glance, but in the long run, it won't help them to understand the material or get better at solving similar problems.  Many of us would prefer to focus on questions that will ""feed you for a lifetime"", e.g., by answering conceptual questions that will be useful beyond this one specific exercise.</p>

<p>Also, some or many of the experts here <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1151/755"">aren't very interested</a> in devoting their energy towards a site whose primary purpose is to help with homework.  If we answered homework questions, we'd risk being swamped by homework questions, and then some or many of the experts might leave, leading to a downward spiral for the site.  We want to avoid that.  Don't take it personally.</p>

<p>In general, as articulated on CS Theory, we want questions here to be inspired based on the spirit of knowledge sharing, not shirking.  As they say there:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should only post questions you're actually seriously thinking about. Users are expected to do their part and try to answer their question by themselves before posting them on cstheory and asking for help from others. Search to see if your question is already answered somewhere else (e.g. Wikipedia) before asking a question. <strong>Try to make your question interesting for others by providing some background knowledge.</strong> Remember, <em>questions should be based on knowledge sharing, not on shirking. Shirking goes against the spirit of the site.</em></p>

5,"<p>D.W. explains <em>what</em> to ask. Here are some pointer towards <em>how</em>.</p>

<p>Wait, first the <em>when</em>:</p>

<p>First, <strong>talk to people</strong>, namely fellow students, TAs and teachers (in that order). Many problems go away after you talk to somebody who is thinking about the same problem, or has done so before.</p>

<p>If that is no option (<em>really</em>?) or does not work out: <strong>Google your problem.</strong> Formulating a proper web search takes practice and is an indispensible skill. So have at it. Chances are that you find your answer immediately. Maybe you find somebody with the same problem but they got answers that don't help you. Or you find something that helps you get a little farther but not all the way. In any case, you have something more to tell when asking the question.</p>

<p>Few things are more embarrassing (for you) and annoying (for us) than a question that can be answered by reading the <strong>Wikipedia</strong> article found by using the exact terms from a posted question.</p>

<p>Our <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/599/reference-answers-to-frequently-asked-questions"">reference questions</a> can also be useful; many standard types of exercise problems are covered there. Go have a look!</p>

<p>Now, the <em>how</em>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Be precise</strong>. Not only about what the original problem is, but also
about what, specifically, your issues at this point in time is.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include all necessary information.</strong> That includes problem statments, (non-standard) definitions and theorems you think you need, <em>to the letter</em>. Of course, stick to <strong>only necessary</strong> data.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that most of your readers do not attend the same course as you.
They have seen different definitions, have used different books. You need to
give them what they need to understand the task, as close as you can estimate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pick a meaningful title.</strong> If you have followed D.W.'s advice, you should be able to formulate a short question using natural language. If not, chances are you are not ready to ask yet.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/815/98"">here</a> for some details on writing good titles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Give proper credit/references.</strong> Where does the problem come from? Where did you read this or that? Which book are you using? This is part academic ethics and courtesy, and part pragmatism: if experts know which book(s) you have they can focus their own research and tailor their answers.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1201/98"">here</a> for advice on referencing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imagine you are asking a professor or TA.</strong> Use this rule whenever you are unsure about any of the other points. Also, use it to inform your tone, expectations, and responses to comments you may get. Keep in mind that you are asking others to spend their time on your problem, without compensation. They are willing to help, but don't waste their time and energy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Work with feedback you are getting.</strong> Somebody posts a hint -- go try to work from there. Somebody seems to misunderstand your post -- go improve it (click ""edit""). Answer questions you are getting in the comments and continue to update the question to clarify.</p></li>

5,"<p>One long-standing feature requests for the Stack Exchange engine is the implementation of <em>trackbacks</em> for mentions of the arXiv on Stack Exchange sites. In general, if you have a blog and you blog about an arXiv eprint, you can send the arXiv a specially crafted http message, and then your blog gets listed on a page of the form</p>
<pre><code>http://arXiv.org/tb/paper-id
</code></pre>
<p>that lists a bunch of internet locations that discuss the eprint. Some more examples of how this works:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Example:</em> <a href=""http://arxiv.org/tb/0905.2658"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> is a list of trackbacks to the arXiv preprint <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2658"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">arXiv:0905.2658</a> from various blogs. My feature-request is that if a future SE post mentions an arXiv number, say, <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2658"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">arXiv:0905.2658</a>, then a trackback is automatically sent to the arXiv.org who then adds the SE post to the <a href=""http://arxiv.org/tb/0905.2658"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trackback list</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Example:</em> <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/30320/2451"">This</a> SE answer mentions the arXiv preprint <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.2895"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">arXiv:0707.2895</a>. With trackbacks to the arXiv, it would be possible to see on the corresponding <a href=""http://arxiv.org/tb/0707.2895"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trackback list</a> that this preprint is mentioned on SE.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>More Examples:</em> (<a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/9727/2451"">SE question</a>, <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5222"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">arXiv preprint</a>, <a href=""http://arxiv.org/tb/1103.5222"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trackback list</a>);

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For recent trackbacks from across the internet to the whole of arXiv, see <a href=""http://arxiv.org/tb/recent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://arxiv.org/tb/recent</a>.</p>
<p>The trackback mechanism was implemented and put online on <a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/"">MathOverflow</a> in 2013, and it has been ticking along ever since. A feature request was posted at about that time on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/"">Meta Stack Exchange</a> to enable this across all the science Stack Exchange sites, at <strong><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/240520/trackbacks-from-se-to-the-arxiv-org"">Trackbacks from SE to the arXiv.org?</a></strong>  That proposal has received a lot of love over the years (currently at score 62) but apparently this has not been enough.</p>
<p>So: do you think this trackback mechanism should be enabled on this site? If so, either post an answer here saying Aye, or go show <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/240520/trackbacks-from-se-to-the-arxiv-org"">that feature-request</a> some (more) love.</p>

5,"<p>Questions are expected to be self-contained.  They should contain all the information needed to understand and answer the question, in the post itself.  They can certainly include external links to provide supplementary material or additional context, but those shouldn't be necessary to understand the question.</p>

<p>This is a standard guideline for all Stack Exchange sites.  See, e.g.,</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/122361/160917"">FAQ suggestion: that a question should be a single question, self-contained</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>What should you do if you see a question that is not self-contained, and can't be understood from just the information provided in the post?  One of three things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Leave a comment for the author asking them to edit the question to make it self-contained, and explaining how this site works (we want posts to be self-contained, we're trying to build an archive of high-quality questions that might be useful to others in the future, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, edit the question to make it self-contained, if you feel inspired to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can vote to close as 'unclear what you're asking', if you have privilege to  do that and you think that's the best way to ensure the question gets clarified.</p></li>

The project Euler policy is ""to solve by yourself"", which I am in favour of. I also know asking hints for ongoing contests is not correct. But Project Euler is not a ""contest which runs for a limited time"". From how I have learned from programming contest questions is to take hints from someone after the contest is over, <em>only if</em> I have spent a considerable amount of time with a specific problem and am stuck on it. But Project Euler is kind of  a contest which goes on indefinitely, the only way I can learn is: try the problem for days ( maybe weeks ) and if I am stuck ask for hints on stackexchange ( in all my questions I mention the problem link and specify that I am looking for some hint regarding my approach that I mention in the question ). I suppose this is better than giving up on the question after days of not making any progress.  <br></p>

<p>In my experience, there will often not be such papers, so the question is probably ""please tide me over from abstract description to code""; that's a programmer's task and clearly offtopic here.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Let's break it down:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Asking for an open-source implementation</strong> is off-topic.  Asking for an open-source implementation to do X is equivalent to asking for a software package to do X.  They're both off-topic here.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/31/755"">https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/31/755</a> for a relevant policy statement: ""[asking] for a complete software package [...] is <em>definitely</em> out of our mandate as the underlying problem/task is not related to computer science"".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asking for an algorithm</strong> for some well-defined task certainly is on-topic here.  That's our bread and butter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asking for papers that describe an algorithm</strong> for some well-defined task is on-topic.</p>

<p>A note of advice: in my opinion, it's probably more useful to ask for an algorithm to do X, rather than asking for a paper that describes an algorithm to do X.  If you ask for an algorithm to do X, you might get back a paper reference, or you might get back an algorithm even if there is no paper. If you ask for a paper, you've ruled out an entire class of useful answers.  But either one is in scope and on-topic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asking for papers that describe how to implement an algorithm for this task</strong> feels borderline to me.  It could be OK -- or it might be problematic.  The risk is that there may not be any paper that describes how to do an entire implementation, including all relevant implementation issues.  And many implementation considerations tend to be a matter for Stack Overflow; we focus on the science (e.g., algorithms, concepts, fundamental techniques, rather than programming language specific concerns).</p>

<p>My advice would be to start by asking for an algorithm for the task; then, if you run into any <em>specific</em> issue with implementing the algorithm, ask another question about that specific issue, either on Stack Overflow or here, depending on whether the issue has to do with fundamental computer science concepts or has more to do with programming/coding.  Asking for implementation advice before you even have an approach or algorithm seems to me like it's getting ahead of things.  But this is just friendly advice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asking for ""X or Y"" where X is off-topic and Y is on-topic</strong> is not good practice and risks having your question closed as off-topic.  Don't ask for something you know is off-topic here; remove all the off-topic requests from your question, and focus only on the part that is on-topic.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, to make your question on-topic, you'll need to remove the part of your question that asks for an open-source implementation.</p>

<p>If you want to rehabilitate the question to be on-topic here, for your sake, I'd recommend that you focus on asking for an algorithm for power graph analysis/visualization, rather than on asking for a document or paper -- but that is your choice.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: In this answer I'm focusing only on what's on-topic.  Even if the question is edited to be on-topic, it will still need to meet our other requirements, including being focused enough that it can be answered in a few paragraphs; containing enough information that the task/question is well-defined; and describing what research you've done and what approaches you've considered.  As it stands, the question is open-ended and what you mean by ""power graph analysis/visualization"" is not explained, so you would do better to explain what you mean by that: what tasks do you want to be able to do?  what visualizations do you want to produce?  what requirements do you have for any such system?</p>

5,"<p>The Stack Exchange network is somewhat split on how to handle shopping recommendations.

However, there are sites which allow such questions, with varying degrees of success. </p>

<p>Does Computer Science want to keep these questions open, or close them? The most common example here would probably be textbook recommendations, although it is best to make a more general policy. </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>As a rule, we don't get questions that ask for <em>shopping</em> recommendations here. We get <em>literature</em> recommendation questions sometimes. That's different.</p>

<p>“Shopping question” to mean questions whose answers are likely to involve pre-existing things (a piece of computer hardware, a software package, a book, etc.) is an unfortunate piece Stack Exchange slang. It essentially has a pejorative meaning. By using this term, you are driving the discussion towards a specific answer — “if you defend shopping questions, you're bad”. Please refrain.</p>

<p>There are at least two distinct types of questions asking for literature recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions asking what paper to cite on a given topic. These questions usually have an answer which is a single paper (or “it's folklore”). A significant fraction of our <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reference-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reference-request</a> questions are of this type. While I tend to find these questions boring, they do not raise any particular moderation issue.</li>
<li><p>Questions asking what to read on a given topic. These questions are problematic to moderate, because they tend to degenerate into lists of items. Stack Exchange has no problem with recommendations — we just want them to be <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">constructive</a> — but Stack Exchange is not good with polls. The problems with questions that call for lists (“what books should I read?”) is that they tend to attract answers that say “you should include this one book in your reading”, which doesn't really answer the question. An answer should <strong>recommend a curriculum</strong>, not a single item. See <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/20/what-about-list-questions/26#26"">What about list questions?</a>  </p>

<p>We have no ban on questions asking for a curriculum, and we should not have one. The usual quality control does apply, of course. If a question is too broad (lacking information about the scope of the topics that should be covered), or primarily opinion-based (lacking context to rate which books/papers are most relevant), then it should be closed. Furthermore, we should apply quality control on answers: please downvote and flag answers that recommend a single item rather than a full reading list.</p></li>

5,"<p>I'd guess it's a side effect of the fact that Stack Exchange considers comments second-class citizens: transient, liable to disappear at any time, not a priority for preserving, etc.</p>

<p>My personal feeling is that by holding the line on question quality, this problem will disappear.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1033/towards-a-policy-for-hint-only-answers?cb=1#comment3150_1033"">comment from Raphael</a> clued me in to this opinion (though I'm not implying he shares it):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I daresay that a <em>good</em> question that asks only for a hint will contain all the usual good stuff: independent thought, attempts, and such. They then ask for a hint on how to proceed. This should usually allow for richer answers then the type of question I assume above.  ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just a problem statement by itself that is purely a copy of a homework question with no attempts made to answer any part of it, should be closed.</p>

<p>One key point: <strong>Most homework problems are not questions <em>about math</em>.</strong>  They may be questions about Farmer Brown's potato field, or questions about the value of X, or about the height of the rod or the volume of Johnny's swimming pool, but they are not questions <em>about math</em>.  Sometimes they aren't questions at all, but only instructions: ""Find the value of X if Y is greater than 23.""</p>

<p>Thus if they are questions they are off-topic, as swimming pools, potato fields and such are not the topic of this site, and if they are instructions only they should be closed as ""unclear what you are asking.""  ;)</p>

<p><sub>(Lest this be perceived as splitting hairs, the above is very slightly tongue-in-cheek.  I believe this is a case where a purely literal interpretation of the rules, as I describe, has the advantage of <em>also</em> being correct.  I'm not saying ""follow the rules because those are the rules,"" but rather ""I believe the policy we should apply is ______, and hey, look, you can derive that from an overly literal interpretation of the rules!"")  :)</sub></p>

I think the distinction between the two is too subtle and people won't know how to use them (and the current tag wikis don't help).</p>

<p>I looked through some questions tagged <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/didactics"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;didactics&#39;"" rel=""tag"">didactics</a> and all of them seem like they could equally well be tagged <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/education"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;education&#39;"" rel=""tag"">education</a> (in fact, most of them already are tagged with both tags).  They certainly aren't currently used in a manner consistent with the distinction <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/206/755"">Raphael proposed earlier</a>, so even if we previously thought that distinction might be useful, I think experience over the past 4 years suggests that we were over-thinking it.

<p>Moreover, I looked over all 9 questions tagged <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/computational-linguistics"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;computational-linguistics&#39;"" rel=""tag"">computational-linguistics</a>, and every one falls into one of three categories:</p>

<p>In my view, there's not enough question traffic or value in the distinction to warrant two tags; and even if there were, in practice people aren't using the tags in a way that's consistent with that distinction.</p>

5,"<h2>A word of warning</h2>

<p>If what you are working on <em>has</em> been assigned to you for homework, asking about it on the internet may <strong>defeat the purpose of the exercise</strong>.</p>

<p>If your teachers know what they are doing¹, assigned exercises will encourage you to</p>

<ol>
<li>review the requisite material,</li>
<li>work with the definitions and theorems², </li>
<li>connect different concepts,</li>
<li>(occasionally) have new ideas, thus deepening your understanding, and</li>
<li>communicate your thoughts using shared, technical terminology and notation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Think of it like you think of football practice: you have to kick the ball thousands of times before you can reliably hit the goal in a match and in a variety of circumstances. Similarly, you have to perform, say, proofs by induction a couple of dozen times (at least) before you get really good at it and start to see patterns.</p>

<p>If you outsource significant parts of the exercise-solving process, you rob <em>yourself</em> of a learning opportunity. It <em>is</em> the process that counts, not whether you get a 100% correct answer on the end (even though that would be nice). </p>

<p>What is ""significant""? Depends. There are no clear-cut rules. It's probably okay, both in the sense above and that below, if you ask about one step in a two-page proof. It's <em>certainly not</em> okay to just post the whole exercise.
Use your best judgement.</p>

<p><strong>Interlude:</strong> I am fully aware that typical systems of the form ""you have to earn X% of the points to pass or be allowed to take the final exam"" mask what I write above, and create external motivation to get that perfect answer on paper in any way possible. That sucks. Remember that <em>you</em> chose to study CS; please take responsibility of your own learning process, and that includes realizing that <em>you have to do the work yourself</em>³. 10000 hours to mastery -- look it up.</p>

<p>Now, teachers and schools know all this and may take measures that are as clumsy as they are desparate, all to make you learn: they write up regulations that forbid getting outside help on your homework. That would include asking a question here. <strong>Violating such rules may get you failing grades in a course, or even expelled from your school.</strong> Check the statutes of your school, department, and course.</p>

<p><em>Final warning:</em> Once you post a question and get answers, the material is considered property of the community, as per the terms of use of Stack Exchange. If you delete your question without good reason (erasing traces of you cheating is not one, for example) we will undelete it. We can not know what is allowed where, so we do not discriminate when answering -- but also not when wanting to keep good content. So <strong>think before you post</strong>.</p>

<li>Please accept that you are probably not in the position to judge if they are.</li>

<li><p>To me, the questions I asked in a post are closely related to each other
that they are explanations of one single question, and show my
understanding and uncertainty about that single question. </p>

<p>Some people have different opinions from mine above, maybe because of the
following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When some people see multiple questions in one place, they think it is too much, or can't get to understand that my
intention of asking them was to provide various thoughts including
uncertainties of mine about one subject, which may also be
directions for others to help me find about why I was confused with
the subject.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people have negative view about the way that I organize the questions in my post, or the way I phrase them. I don't claim that I am not good at them, but I tried to do the best that I could.</p></li>
<li><p>As a self learner and most of time a beginner to many subjects, the confusions that I have might not be the case to those
experienced, and the questions that I consider as closely related
might not be the case to them. </p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, from my perspective, I have also seen someone who wasn't familiar with the subject that I was asking about, didn't
quite understand what I was asking about yet (sometimes maybe
because of my fault, and I was willing to improve them to the best
that I could), but felt quite confident to vote to close or
downvote my posts because of multiple questions in one post.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>As far as I am aware, there are two kinds of ""resolutions"":</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I separate them into multiple posts so that one post one question, that will likely make them seem more or less isolated from
each other, and make others not easily understand my intention of
asking the single question, and my thoughts for it. </p></li>
<li><p>Often I could have made a post with much fewer questions, by changing subquestions into nonquestion sentences. But I didn't do
that was because as a self-learner, I didn't want to sound like I
was completely sure about many things. I hope others not to take my
understandings and thoughts for granted, and could either correct my
misunderstandings or confirm my correct ones if possible.</p></li>

<p>Here's a model that usually doesn't fit our format well:</p>

<p><em>Ask a bunch of different but closely related questions in a single post.</em></p>

<p>Why doesn't that work well in our site's format?  See <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/222735/160917"">Can I ask only one question per post</a> for a detailed explanation.</p>

<p>Please understand, this is not some kind of moralistic judgement.  I'm not saying that people who ask multiple questions are bad people.  This is just a recognition that some types of questions work well for our format and others don't.  Some types of questions don't work as well here, due to limitations of the Stack Exchange platform.  So, we want you to pose questions in a way that respects the Stack Exchange model.</p>

<p>This is also not a purely arbitrary guideline.  There are some reasons behind it.  If you respect and trust people here to give you useful answers on technical matters, I'd ask that you please also respect and trust our experience about what types of questions do and don't work well on Stack Exchange.</p>

<hr>

<p>I get the impression that maybe what's happening is you get curious about a question Q, then you try to read a little bit to see if you can work out the answer yourself, and that uncovers other more basic topics that you are not sure about.  This triggers ""subquestions"" R, S, T, etc.  You respond by posting a single question that includes all of Q, R, S, T.</p>

<p>If so, don't do that -- there's a more constructive way to post here.</p>

<p>Instead, when that happens, treat it as learning exercise.  Pick one of those more basic subquestions, say R.  Now read and study more to see if you can work out the answer to R on your own.  If you can't, ask R as a new question (and show what self-study you've done and what your thoughts are).</p>

<p>After you get the answer to R, absorb the implications, and then use that to figure out what the next question to ask is.  Maybe you next post a question where you ask S.  Or maybe the answer to R has helped you figure out the answers to R and S on your own and now you post a question where you ask T. </p>

<p>Finally, once you've figured out the answer to all the subquestions (R, S, T), you're ready to ask the original question Q you were curious about (assuming by now you haven't already worked out the answer).  Now you should be able to write a good question, where you can explain what reading you did, what your reasoning is, what possible answers you considered and why you rejected them, etc.</p>

<p>Notice that this process still involves asking <em>only one question per question</em>.  That helps it work better in our site's format.  I realize it does require a bit more patience.  Think of that as part of the price of having access to the aggregate wisdom of the community of answerers here.</p>

<p>Notice also that it involves asking the questions <em>sequentially</em>, i.e., with only one question live at a time.  That's because often the answer to one of your questions might help you understand the other questions, rendering it unnecessary to ask them.</p>

<hr>

<p>In short: no, please don't ask multiple subquestions in a single post as a way of explaining your reasoning.  Please try to stick to one question per question.  I hope this answer has given you some ideas about how to go about that.</p>

5,"<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/63798"">This question</a> came up recently and was quickly closed as a duplicate of our reference question referenced in the title of this post. I'm not complaining about the reference question: it does a fine job of describing a lot of the problems and solutions one might have in this area.</p>

<p>My (ongoing) problem is that it seems to me that we're often too quick to pull the ""duplicate of 'Is there a system...' "" trigger. For example, in the question I referenced, the OP's intent was abundantly clear: ""How do I analyze a loop that (1) iterates over every other index and (2) the upper limit decreases on every instance of the loop?""</p>

<p>That's <strong>not</strong> (IMO) answered by the reference question. Rather it was a very specific elementary problem that could be quickly answered with no mention of the reference question. While some people might disagree, I'd also argue that this falls squarely into the cs.SE ballpark of on-topic questions.</p>

<p>I've made this rant before; it's as if a student in my algos class came to my office with that question and I said ""Here's a text on algorithm analysis; read the first two chapters and don't let the door hit you on your butt on the way out.""</p>

<p>My point here is to again request that we stop and think a bit before hitting the close button. Before I enter duck-and-cover mode I suggest that we say to ourselves, ""Does this reference question <em>really</em> address the poster's question, or would a hint or two be more appropriate?""</p>

5,"<p>We have a close reason that reads</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions about <strong>software development or programming tools</strong> are off-topic here, but can be asked on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/about"">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not as helpful as it could be. Moderators can and do migrate questions that are in a good enough state to stand on Stack Overflow (but we miss some when the question gets closed before a moderator sees it; in such cases the asker can just react). We should use a generic close reason for questions that are so far from being viable that we don't want to even suggest another site. So the primary target of that reason is people who've asked questions that could be suitable for Stack Overflow, but are not suitable in their current state, and who are going to read some short guidance. (We can't do anything about the ones who won't read the guidance anyway.)</p>

<p>What should we say? We have 400 characters including formatting.</p>

<p>In my experience, programming questions on CS mostly come into the following types, from most common to least:</p>

<ol>
<li>Programming homework in computer science courses.</li>
<li>Programmers (students or not) who are “implementing an algorithm” and so feel that it's computer science, even if their problem is which library function to use or with the language syntax.</li>
<li>People who've read “computer” in the site name and didn't bother to think about the second word.</li>
<li>People who are blocked from asking on SO and try their luck elsewhere.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this breakdown, I think that the main goal should be to drive people to write a complete question, with code and a clearly stated problem, while discouraging “do my homework”.</p>

<p>I've also <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/336523/guidance-when-closing-programming-questions-on-computer-science"">asked the Stack Overflow community</a> for their input.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I had a question to propose a design for a potential computer system architecture and I was curious on caveats / potential issues within in, but I'm <em>not</em> quite sure if it fits here. Based on the help center I've seen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Computer science, also sometimes called computing science, is the science of computation and its applications. This site covers theoretical and applied computer science at any level, including but not limited to:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>algorithms, models of computation</li>
  <li><strong>programming language semantics, formal methods</strong></li>
  <li><strong>computer architecture</strong>, networks</li>
  <li>machine learning, artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, natural language processing</li>
  <li>vision, graphics</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The following topics are usually not suitable for this site:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Programming questions are off-topic here, even if they're homework from a class in a computer science curriculum. You may ask on Stack Overflow.</li>
  <li>Questions about how a <strong>particular piece of software or hardware works aren't science</strong> (unless you're asking about the scientific concepts behind that software or hardware). You may ask on Super User or other appropriate technology sites.</li>
  <li>Questions about numerical computation are often more appropriate for Computational Science Stack Exchange.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>Now, to the first two bolded points: the question would involve a <em>slight</em> discussion on a programming language semantics and design, as it's regarding the embedding of a programming language within itself (think assembly but a little more abstract), it would also <strong>almost entirely</strong> revolve around the architecture design itself (mostly taking a nod at x86 / x64 for a base).</p>

<p>The third: the question would talk about a theoretical piece of hardware.</p>

<p>Next, from another section of the help area:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking subjective questions where …</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”</li>
  <li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”</li>
  <li>there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”</li>
  <li>you are asking an open-ended, <strong>hypothetical question</strong>: “What if ______ happened?”</li>
  <li>your question is just a rant in disguise: “______ sucks, am I right?”
  (The above section was adapted from MetaFilter’s FAQ.)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Some subjective questions are allowed, but “subjective” does not mean “anything goes”. All subjective questions are expected to be constructive. What does that mean? Constructive subjective questions:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>inspire answers that <strong>explain “why” and “how”</strong></li>
  <li>tend to have <strong>long, not short, answers</strong></li>
  <li>have a <strong>constructive, fair, and impartial tone</strong></li>
  <li>invite sharing experiences over opinions</li>
  <li>insist that opinion be backed up with <strong>facts and references</strong></li>
  <li>are more than just mindless social fun</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The points I'm concerned about I've emboldened once again.</p>

<p>Would a question that meets this criteria be, in fact, on-topic? If you would like me to add portions of what the question itself would be, I will gladly do so for an actual hardened example.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>It's hard to tell exactly what you want to ask, so I'll give some guidelines.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You need to ask a specific, focused question.  ""Here's my design, do you have any feedback?"" probably isn't a great fit for our site format.  An open-ended request for caveats, pitfalls,  or potential issues in your specific design probably isn't a great fit.</p></li>
<li><p>This site isn't for discussion, so a request for discussion or open-ended call for reactions won't be suitable.  </p></li>
<li><p>Try to make your question useful for others.</p></li>
<li><p>Our site is for concepts, algorithms, ideas, science, etc., in the area of computer science.  If it's about gates and circuits, it's probably off-topic here.  However, computer architecture <em>is</em> on-topic.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this helps.  If it's still unclear to you, tell us more about what you want to ask -- or better yet, just give it a try and ask your question on the main site, and I'm sure folks will be happy to offer feedback.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Perhaps, on occasion, following these external links may provide a way for mods to express more clearly what will need to be included into the question. Holding or closing an incomprehensible question that makes use of links without looking at what these links provide seems lazy.

",CSmeta
5,"<p><em>Wrong</em> answers should be downvoted and not flagged. Posts that do not answer the question <em>at all</em> should be deleted, and if you think a post should be deleted, flag it. Common categories of non-answers include:</p>

<li>Insults, etc. — flag as “rude or offensive”</li>

<li>Plagiarism — flag as “in need of moderator intervention” and explain; also edit the post to mention the original source if you can identify it</li>
</ul>

<p>There are ambiguous categories where it isn't always clear whether to delete (possibly after downvoting) or just downvote. The biggest such category is posts that correctly answer a different question. Whether to keep them around depends on how close they match the question: do it represent a common mistake? can it be adjusted to the actual question? Use your judgement, and possibly discuss the specific case in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2710/computer-science"">chat</a> or here on meta.</p>

<p>Another category we get here sometimes is answers that are not about computer science, e.g. a pure code dump as an answer to an algorithm question or a statement (“yes it's true” with no indication of how to prove it or at the very least a reference) to a question asking whether something is true and not explicitly asking how to prove it. We don't have a firm policy on those.

<blockquote>
  <p>this is a computer science site, so questions and answers should to some extent adhere to the scientific method. For answers, that means they should make only falsifiable claims and back them with solid evidence, which can be a (good) reference, (significant) empirical data or a (clear) formal proof (idea). Any answer that does not provide any of the three is likely to be not useful.</p>

Now the original poster has edited it to add enough comments that it could count as badly-written pseudocode. I think in this state it does constitute an answer, so I wouldn't delete it single-handedly, but I would downvote it for being presented really badly.</p>

<p>A third category of barely-answers is hint-only answers. <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1033/towards-a-policy-for-hint-only-answers"">We have no consensus on those</a>, and they can be genuinely helpful to the original asker, so as a moderator I don't feel comfortable deleting them if the question is evidently homework.

5,"<p>I am a student of Computer Science, however for the most part I'm self teaching myself CS(Due to being in a not very good school, which is not internationally competitive or standard. Not to say I don't learn anything in school, but we tend not to cover topics as much as I like.) </p>

<p>So in the books I read, I often encounter exercises which may be difficult, and I attempt to solve. As I have no teacher but myself(I haven't even started a course on Data Structures and/or algorithms yet) I am not able to verify my solutions.</p>

<p>The accepted moderation behavior is to leave these answers alone. Moderators would intervene only if a redundant answer was posted markedly later than the others. If the answers are posted within a few minutes of each other, we don't look at the exact timestamp.</p>

<p>If the posters wish to remove their answer because it's identical to another answer, that's encouraged. But that only goes if the answers are truly near-identical: having answers that explain the same solution in different ways is perfectly fine.</p>

5,"<p>Recently, i was stuck with a problem so i ask a question here hoping someone can help me. I was suprised in a cool way thanks to 2 sweets answears. Both of them help me to figure out the theoritical aspects and an easy way to solve my problem.</p>

<p>Thank to the voting system an answear lead the race of visibility but i consider that both answears are as important as each other for a global understanding, theory and application.</p>

<p>Why not distinguish theoritical answear from pratical ones and let the user choose what he prefers to focus on ?</p>

<p>Moreover even if we stick to one domain. Multiple answear can appear given different options to understand/solve each one with a specific trade off.</p>

<p>To solve this i propose to let contributors specify if there answears are more theory/solve/both oriented by adding topics. And let to everybody the ability to reward all answears by specifying which part of his specific problem this answear help to solve.</p>

<p>Then we will be able to cluster answear by topic with a far better granularity in order to allow efficient searchs to all our problems.</p>

<p>Hope it can help !</p>

5,"<p>It is a bit late into this new year, being that we're already in the second month, but we are now cycling the Community Promotion Ads for 2017!</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>relevant blogs and websites about computer science</li>
<li>computer science events, conferences, or meetups</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1369"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Is the Artificial Intelligence community designed to serve multidisciplinary AI research (or not necessarily a particular research but also using AI methods for certain applications) rather than AI research done by computer scientists alone? Is the main difference between the two communities in that it is designed to serve AI from non-computational aspects as well?</p>

<p>Feel free to answer some or all of the questions above.  Please feel free to share your comments and suggestions.  Thank you very much and we really appreciate all of your honest feedback and help.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The original proposal seemed to be to hold the AMA itself on meta, which isn't <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/whats-meta"">what meta is for</a>. If there is an AMA, it should be on chat.</p>

<p>I also note that the AMA on Physics seems to have run monthly but then had a hiatus of several months. Physics is a rather larger community than ours (they have 133 users who've earnt 100+ reputation so far this month; we have 25) so it seems unlikely that we could sustain weekly AMAs when they couldn't even manage monthly.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Interesting proposal, but I don't think an AMA is the best format for this site. The 'M' part is the part that I think doesn't really fit, why should the focus be on only one person? Couldn't other experts also have good or even better answers to your questions? If you want to know something related to that person in particular, you can simply use the chat without creating a big event.</p>

<p>Therefore, I think a much more interesting event would be an 'expert panel' of some sort about a specific topic, for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>We wouldn't be limited to the expertise or fame of a single person </li>
<li>Since the 'title' of the panel will be a certain topic in CS, even people who do not know a single member of the panel can be interested in participating.</li>
<li>CS has a lot of sub-fields and wildly varying topics. Having panels that restrict themselves to one of these topics can be great to get more knowledge about the many topics related to CS.</li>
<li>After the panel, useful Q&amp;A's can be preserved in a reference question (this is also possible for the AMA, but it feels more natural in this context)</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, the obvious disadvantage is that we would have to find more than one person to participate on the answering side. On the other hand, we can lower our standards as to whom would be suitable (A panel of three serious researchers can be as valuable as an AMA with the leader in their field). Also, since CS is so fragmented, someone 'famous' inside a certain field could be virtually unknown to anyone outside the field, so a 'famous' person might not even exist for some fields!</p>

5,"<p>Just wondering if questions regarding blockchain technology are on topic?</p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">help link</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This site covers theoretical and applied computer science at any level..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd categorise blockchains as applied computer science, and there are a few questions on it already, so I'd say questions are on topic. Perhaps unless the question relates to some specific implementation problem. If it is on topic, would blockchain be worthy of a tag? Or are there adequate synonyms?</p>

5,"<p>Frankly, this is what teachers and teaching assistants are paid for. 
You can also ask peers or more advanced learners you trust.</p>

<p>Reviewing material is generally a bad fit for this platform: it's a task that requires lots of reading (as opposed to a snappy, self-contained question) and has no clear-cut answers.</p>

<p>You may also want to consider carefully if you want to share your unpublished work with strangers. All it takes is one person uploading it somewhere, and suddenly it will be on <em>you</em> to prove that you did not plagiarize.</p>

5,"<p>A question like <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/75260/weighted-edmond-algorithm"">this</a> seems to me to be clearly off-topic, because, although it <em>does</em> reference an algorithm, it appears to only be asking if someone has already coded it. </p>

<p>However, my reading of <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic</a> does not clearly articulate why the question is off topic.

",CSmeta
5,"<p>There have been a number of past discussions of this.  Based on the outcomes of those discussions, my reading is that asking for implementations of an algorithm is off-topic.  Others may have a different view; I don't know.</p>

<p>To get an sense of past discussions, you could start by taking a look at <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1306/755"">Is asking for implementation (any language) or detailed documentation/paper to implement an algorithm off-topic?</a>.

<p>Members of the community with enough reputation can vote to close the question if they consider it off-topic. </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Would it be appropriate to ask questions that elicit community opinion and discussion?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Title: &quot;What's your favorite data structure/algorithm/problem that
satisfies requirements x, y, z? Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Body: &quot;Recently I've looked into data structure/algorithm/problem A
and noticed similarities to others: B, C. Clearly A has <em>these</em>
benefits over B and C. I was wondering if you (the community) knew of
any other similar data structure/algorithm/problems that are similar
or could be applicable to the aforementioned scenario. etc. etc.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would be a question where people could share ideas and opinions about particular CS topics. I would like to imagine this is different than <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303/what-is-a-good-reference-request"">reference request</a>. Although references would be expected in any answer to this, it isn't particularly a <em>request</em>.</p>
<p>I've also seen the <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/663/new-close-reasons-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-and-custom-sub-reasons-off"">opinion-based</a> questions appear to be <em>non-constructive</em>, but this category of non-constructive seems more applicable to a scenario like &quot;I have <em>this</em> problem. What's a good way to solve <em>this</em> problem?&quot;.  Which would elicit opinionated solutions.</p>
<p>I haven't seen too many of these types of questions. I've posted a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/74613/useful-functions-between-polylogarithmic-and-polynomial"">similar sort</a> of question. In my opinion these questions are very beneficial to a community. Allowing people to freely contribute their opinions and passions (in some cases) about a CS topic. Not only that, but there is a <em>discovery factor</em> to the answers. Community members may learn and discover new ideas they had not previously known about which again (in my opinion) seem very beneficial to community members.</p>
<p>With that being said, I do see potential issues similar to the reference request issues and one of my own:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;They have the potential to grow forever, with everyone and their grandmother putting in their favorite resource.&quot;</p>
<p>I think this could be remedied by making sure the topics are <em>narrow</em>. Broad topic (e.g. &quot;What's your favorite tree?&quot;) would yield way too many responses or it would lose value as someone could checkout a wikipedia page on the topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;They tend to accumulate duplicate answers.&quot;</p>
<p>This, again, would be more prevalent for broad questions where community members may not read through all answers and go ahead and write a duplicate without realizing it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;The votes are primarily an indication of who came first, secondarily an indication of popularity, and only very occasionally an indication of suitability.&quot;</p>
<p>In this scenario, popularity might not be such a bad thing. The more interesting and noteworthy the response, the more votes it should receive. In the end I could imagine it being similar to a poll where community members vote for their favorite response. This, again, might actually be a good thing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Stack Exchange is a questions and answers platform. It isn't good at being a collection of links. Lists of books or articles about a general topic can go in tag wikis.&quot;</p>
<p>This, I think, would be the most reasonable issue with these kinds of questions. It very well could end up as a list of links. Although I think the well-needed difference here is that these should be much less than a wiki of topic-related links. It would be unnecessary and uninteresting for members to post answers just because they <em>can</em>. The content <em>should</em> (I say this with high hopes) be valuable and interesting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whence answered, it may die in the abyss, never to see the light of day again.</p>
<p>It would be unrealistic for a community member or bot to poke these types of questions just to get more visibility. If a question like this gets minimal answers then maybe it was not a good question to begin with, maybe no one really cares or knows about the topic enough to begin with. Not all these types of questions are meant to be eye-opening, if only but a few, but hopefully the good ones would not end up like this. Usually if it's a good topic that enough community members care about or are interested in, it will get upvoted which would attract more attention and hopefully more interesting answers and discussion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I feel questions of this nature are a <em>good</em> thing, but I would love to hear other opinions about this.</p>

5,"<p>As the help center <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">clearly states</a>: No, opinion polls and discussions are not okay. Here.</p>

<p>Discussing opinions based on facts is a <em>good</em> thing, but this platform sucks for it. It's better for both the site <em>and</em> the discussion if it's held elsewhere. Stack Exchange Chat <em>can</em> be a prudent alternative.</p>

<p>As for your example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is already a long title, and unfolding the requirements will make it untenable. It an open-ended question that invites opinions, facts, and arguments from all over a whole area of research/work.</p>

<p>Luckily, the proposed body is not about ""favorite"" things at all:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you are working through an undergraduate textbook and it got you to wondering, odds are that this is more likely to be appropriate on CS.SE.  If you are doing research on theoretical computer science (e.g., reading research papers published in peer-reviewed conferences, collaborating on a research project with an established researcher), it might be more appropriate on CSTheory.SE.</p>

<p>Given your comment that you are looking to ""learn the basic ideas about his formalism, obviously not at research-level but in a more divulgative-fashion"", that definitely sounds like a question for CS.SE.  CSTheory.SE is for research-level questions about theoretical computer science.</p>

5,"<p>Some days ago a new user posed a problem and sketched a sweeping line algorithm combined with a tree data structure to solve it. Here the problem, as far as I remember: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a set of rectangles with sides parallel to x and y axes and a set of points. find the point that is enclosed by the largest number of rectangles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was the link to the question before it was deleted: 
<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/79534/point-contained-in-the-most-rectangles"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/79534/point-contained-in-the-most-rectangles</a></p>

<p>The user also tried to give an estimation of the running time. My impression was that both the algorithm and the running time estimation were correct.
He wrote that he wants to know if the algorithm is correct because he is not familiar with this kind of algorithm. 
A user told him in a comment that such kind of questions (check my algorithm and maybe check the estimation) are not welcome here. When I came back to this page some time later it was removed.</p>

<p>As far as I can see question of how to solve a problem algorithmically are allowed on this site. Also I see that posters should try as much as possible to solve there problem and also post their efforts here and tell what is there problem (""What have you tried and where did you get stuck?"")
So im very puzzled by the fact that reviewing an algorithm and its running time is not in scope off this site. Does the user post too much? should he only post the first three lines  of his algorithm and write ""I do not know how to continue and do not know how to estimate the running time""? The seems to be a little bit ridiculous. But it also seems to be the consequence of such a ""we do not review"" policy.</p>

5,"<p>The two extremes are questions that are essentially ""Please solve this exercise for me"" and those that are essentially ""Please grade my solution to this exercise."" Neither of these is a good question for this site: the former because we're not in the business of doing people's homework for them; the latter because questions are expected to be generally useful, and it's unlikely that anyone will ever want that answer graded again.</p>

<p>In particular, the now-deleted linked question essentially just says, ""Here's my answer. Could you check it, please? I'm not very confident in it.""  If they'd asked concrete questions about their solution (e.g., I've assumed that every widget is green but I can't prove that&nbsp;&ndash; is it true? Can I avoid that assumption?) then the question would have been fine. Indeed, in that case, the question could have been asked as a question about the colour of widgets and only mentioned the exercise and attempted answer in passing as motivation. Surely people will want to know about the colour of widgets in the future, so the question is generally useful.</p>

<p>To specifically address the question of whether somebody can show too much effort, I'd say generally no. But we have to be clear about what the problem actually is. In the case of ""Please grade my answer"", the problem isn't the exercise the asker was trying to solve but, rather, the unstated thing that's causing them not to be confident about their solution. So the problem with this kind of question is that the asker has shown too much effort on something that <em>isn't</em> their problem, and hasn't even said what their problem is.</p>

5,"<p>I am a new user (from last five months ), I have seen some users ( I don't want to take their names ) have asked a very very basic question or just definition around 4 or 5 year back, due to these questions their reputation has become in thousands. My question is very clear, Is this thing fair to new users? I am also not interested in getting a high reputation on this site. In my opinion, there should down voting (automatically) also if somebody is there from a very long time not active on this site. There should be some balance between the reputation os new users and older ones. One more thing at  present time to get a higher reputation on this site as compared to older times is very tough, So that we also need to take care. </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Is it fair?  I don't know.  Fairness is notoriously subjective.  What's fair to one person, is often unfair to another.  Since you mention you're new to the community, it might be helpful to first learn what the justification is for the current system.  So let me suggest a different question: Does reputation serve its purpose?</p>

<p>What is the purpose of reputation?  It's presumably to help the site succeed at its goals.  What are the site's goals, you say?  I'm glad you asked.  In my view, our mission is to build up an archive of  high-quality questions and answers that will be useful not only to the person who asked the question, but also to others in the future.  This means we want a reputation system that incentivizes behaviors that contributes to that mission, discourages behaviors that don't detract from it, can be implemented in software, and hopefully is as simple as possible.  It doesn't need to be perfect as long as it is ""good enough"".</p>

<p>How well does the current reputation system serve that purpose?  It seems to be doing OK, though it's definitely not perfect and it's certainly got some side effects that might be undesirable.  What about the specific case of  questions that were asked a long time ago -- should they earn more reputation?  Maybe.  Here are two reasons why that might be reasonable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, not all old questions get a lot of upvotes; many don't.  When you see an old question with a lot of upvotes, often that is because the question has turned out to be useful to many other visitors -- and in that case it does seem reasonable that it might earn the participants more reputation.  You too can ask great questions and post great answers, and if they turn out to be useful to lots of other people, over time they will earn you lots of reputation.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, participation in the early days of the site is especially valuable.  The early days of a site like this are especially important, because one needs to grow a community.  In those days, it was unclear whether the site will succeed or fail; it's one thing to participate when you already know that the site will have a lasting legacy, but people who were participating in the alpha or beta days were doing so at a time when it was unclear whether the site would survive.  By participating, they helped the site grow and become attractive to others.  So, it doesn't  feel unreasonable that users who participated from the start and helped the site get off the ground should be receiving more reputation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That said, understand that I'm not trying to say the reputation system is perfect.  There are a bunch of aspects of it that are known to be odd.  Reputation tends to reflect the amount of activity on the site, rather than the knowledge of the participants.  There's a lot of randomness; you might write 100 good answers, and one might just happen to get a lot of attention and lots of upvotes.  Reputation often isn't correlated to the amount of effort you put in or the difficulty of the answer: sometimes answers to easy questions get a lot of upvotes, because it's easy for everyone to see that they are correct, while a lengthy answer to a hard question might get only a few upvotes because most people don't feel qualified to evaluate it.  And Hot Network Questions can distort votes by a large amount.</p>

<p>So there are certainly many aspects of the reputation system that seem odd.  But hopefully it averages out in the end, and is ""good enough"" to help the site succeed.</p>

<p>You asked about removing points from older users who no longer participate.  What would the benefit of that be?  How would your life be different or better, if someone descended with a magic wand and made that happen?  I suspect it would make no difference.  For instance, if the older user isn't active any longer, it doesn't matter how much reputation they have.  In any case, you can still ask good questions that will be visible to others, contribute to the site by posting good answers, and participate in all the usual ways.  What does reputation really do for you?  Almost nothing.  They're just Internet points.  Basically, all reputation does is unlock access to some tools that will help you moderate the site -- but all the most important ways to contribute to the site (ask good questions that will be useful to others and spur good answers; post good answers to other questions; make edits to  improve the site) are available to you regardless of reputation.</p>

<p>Lastly, let me suggest a framing for how to think about reputation.  It's not a race.  Don't think of it as a competition, where the one with the highest rep wins.  Rather, think of it as a cooperation.  We're all working together to build a great site that will spread knowledge throughout the world, and help others learn computer science.  When you see someone else get a bunch of reputation for a good contribution, let's appreciate their contribution and hope they'll come back and keep contributing.  And when you see someone get a bunch of reputation for what seems like a poor contribution, well, sometimes that happens, but we shouldn't let it stop us from making the site better.</p>

<p>It's good to have you on the site.  I hope you'll stay and continue contributing good content.</p>

Newcomers simply do not read the description.</p>

<p>In the past, it was suggested to simply <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/679/why-are-there-tags-for-programming-languages"">remove such tags</a>, but it was decided not to do so, since the lack of a tag would <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1146/43599"">hardly stop the off-topic questions</a>, who would use other tags. Indeed, some off-topic programming questions often misuse <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programming-languages"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;programming-languages&#39;"" rel=""tag"">programming-languages</a> instead, consequently notifying its followers / subscribers.</p>

<p>This problem could be mitigated if the UI was improved to somehow warn new users.</p>

<p>Here's a possible design. A tag can be marked as a ""problematic"" one by moderators. When a low reputation user is about to ask a question with a problematic tag, the UI shows a confirmation dialog titled ""Your question might be off-topic!"", highlighting the tag description (or wiki?), and asking the user to confirm the submission. Tag descriptions/wikis for those tags would be updated with this in mind.</p>

<p>A simpler alternative would be to warn all new users on all tags, or to make the tag descriptions more prominent somehow.</p>

<p>I expected an answer which would outline what possible measures there are, so that I could choose which metric is most suitable for my research (which is unfortunately confidential, so I couldn't share all details which I would like).</p>

<p>Instead, I got patronising replies of the kind ""it seems to be an XY type of question"" (implying that I don't know what I want - untrue) and my question was put ""on hold"" (which feels like being singled out for some punishment / criticism).

",CSmeta
5,"<p>Thanks for coming here to raise the issue, share your perspective, and ask how to improve your question.  I'll share my personal perspective (with the understanding that others might not agree with it).</p>

<p>I'm inclined to agree with closure of that question in its current form.  I'd prefer to see this site for focused questions that admit an objective answer -- or at least where it is possible to objectively evaluate proposed answers -- as I think that's where the site format works best.  This means that the question needs to define the requirements or criteria that should be used for evaluating answers.  Answerers need that information so they can tell what would count as a satisfactory answer for you, and voters need that so they can tell which answers to upvote.</p>

<p>Right now the question feels like it has the form ""please give me a list of possible distance metrics; I'm not telling you how I will evaluate them, but please give me a list so that I can choose one, using criteria that I haven't listed in the question"".  I don't think that's a good fit here.  We want you to think through what your requirements or criteria are before asking and articulate them in the question.  Sometimes a helpful way to do that is to come up with some possible metrics on your own, see if you're happy with any of them, and if not, think about why  you've rejected them and what requirements/criteria that implies you have.</p>

<p>There tends to be some skepticism about ""list of X"" questions, because they are so open-ended.  In particular, there is an infinite number of possible distance metrics, with no clear way provided in the question to select among them.  No answers could reasonably enumerate all possible distance metrics, and that's a hint that the question isn't focused enough.  It's also unfair to answerers: it asks them to spend a lot of time typing out many candidate metrics, most of which you are going to reject.  Since you're asking for help and time from others, I think it makes more sense for you to first figure out how you plan to choose among the candidates, and make that clear in the question.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> see that you provide some criteria in the question: ""easy to compute on graphs of size 10"", ""invariant to permutations of nodes"".  That's helpful.  Unfortunately, as the comments indicate, these aren't enough to narrow things down sufficiently yet: there are still an unbounded number of distance metrics.  As <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/83576/distance-measure-for-directed-acyclic-graphs#comment179134_83576"">David Richerby explains</a>, essentially everything is easy to compute when the graphs has size 10, so that doesn't really narrow things down.  And ""invariant with respect to relabelling of nodes"" is in some sense part of the definition of a graph metric.  It's good that you include it, but it also doesn't narrow things down to a small list of possible answers.</p>

<p>So, this doesn't mean that your question can't work here.  It just means we need more information before the question is answerable.  It means that if you'd like the question to be open here, you should edit the question to clarify.  What do you want the distance metric to measure?  How will you evaluate a proposal?</p>

<p>Please don't view the responses as hostility.  I don't see it as being hostile or aggressive towards you, personally.  Rather, it's addressing the substance of your question: it looks to me like people are trying to keep question quality high and make sure questions are suitable for our site's format, and gather the information they'd need to give a good answer.</p>

5,"<p>Please don't ask the question again.  If you find an old question that is unanswered but you're still interested in, you can provide a bounty.  This will bring it back to the front page and bring it some attention.</p>

<p>Specifically, my advice would be to: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If a title contains 'plaintext formulas', such as <code>Is O(n^2/2) &lt;= O(n^2)?</code>, do <strong>not</strong> edit it to replace it by Mathjax (which you <em>should</em> do if this occurs in the body of the question). You may replace it by 'unicode math': <code>Is O(n²/2) ≤ O(n²)?</code>, or remove the formulas completely <code>What is the effect of halving in big-O notation?</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If a title already contains 'unicode math' (and is fine otherwise), don't touch it. I've seen people editing to replace unicode math with Mathjax in titles. <strong>Stop that.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If a title already contains Mathjax, you may wish to replace it by unicode math or remove the formula as in the first part. Just watch out for people willing to replace it by Mathjax again. Direct them to this answer, if you wish.</p></li>

<p>Allow me to give a 'critique' of both questions:</p>

<p>For the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/79694/is-this-possible-to-solve-boolean-satisfiablility-by-using-karnaugh-maps-to-simp"">first question</a>:</p>

<p>First ten paragraphs explain a method to use Karnaugh maps to solve 3SAT. Then, 2 examples are given where this method works well and finally the question asks whether this method would work in general. </p>

<p>The question is a bit lengthy, but in general, it is on point.</p>

<p>For the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/87351/is-this-possible-to-solve-the-boolean-satisfiability-problem-deterministically-i"">second question</a>: </p>

<p>The first ten paragraphs explain an interpretation of SAT and how to apply induction. This part could already lead some to down-vote, given that this 1. doesn't give any information about your question 2. anyone capable of answering this question knows about SAT and induction. Personally, I'd just scrap it or at least shorten it to one paragraph. </p>

<p>The rest of question explains the method and argues it could be efficient.</p>

<p>So, IMO, the first question is better, as it doesn't bore the reader in the first ten paragraphs by only explaining <em>non-trivial</em> background. Additionally, the examples are useful, as they show that the method may have <em>some</em> merit. Note that my critique is purely on the <em>presentation</em> of the question, which can always be improved. It is possible that the second question is also worse in content than the other, but I can't really evaluate that.</p>

<p>As for the reason why people vote, that's anyone's guess, as Raphael notes. But it could be the case that, as David Richerby states in <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/87351/is-this-possible-to-solve-the-boolean-satisfiability-problem-deterministically-i#comment187278_87351"">this comment</a>, that while most users are tolerant to <em>a few</em> questions about (most-likely incorrect) proofs about P vs NP, they don't like handling many of them. So, the down-votes could also be a discouragement to post similar question. However, this is just a guess. The only way to know is to ask the down/close-voters themselves.</p>

5,"<p>It's almost February in 2018, which isn't supposed to be the proper time to cycle these, but for this year it'll be once again, so we'll be refreshing the <strong>Community Promotion Ads</strong> for this year now!</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>relevant blogs and websites about computer science</li>
<li>computer science events, conferences, or meetups</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1452"">here</a>.</p>

5,"<p>The P-vs-NP question has a long history of attracting laypeople trying to solve it with usually naive methods. If they don't even bother to present their attempt in suitable terms, and/or are resilient to critique, they are called ""cranks"". They will usuaully reject responses that don't agree with them, and refuse to engage in scientific discourse.</p>

<p>All active members on this site have dealt with such people at some point or another, and it has been decided that we don't want to entertain them.

<p>On the other hand, a well-presented (partial) proof attempt or idea may have a clear, illustrative answer. Some of our regular users take joy in engaging in productive discussion with such askers, even though they have to assume that the attempt <em>probably</em> doesn't work.

I would be surprised if they had any clear policy, even individually; it probably depends on what tickles their fancy. <em>And that is completely okay.</em> Everybody is here on their own leisure, and nobody is entitled to others' time.</p>

<p>Now, I have not read either of the two questions you link in detail, so I couldn't comment on which side (cranky-boring or interestingly-wrong) either falls. There is certainly a grey area in between, and votes might depend on who reads a question first and which mood they are in. That's because everybody here is human.</p>

5,"<p>Thanks for raising this.  I think this should be addressed now.</p>

<p>This was my fault.  You are right that, normally, downvoted questions can't be deleted if they have an upvoted answer.  Here's what happened.  Yesterday I dealt with a sockpuppet ring.  This triggers automatic deletion of all questions with a vote score below 0 from the socks.  I manually reviewed all such deletions to make sure we weren't losing good questions, and rescued some of them.  There were three remaining questions that I judged weren't worth keeping because the questions were so specific that I doubted anyone would ever have the same question again.  So, I left them deleted.</p>

<p>However, after looking at this again, you raise a good point; for at least two of those questions, the answers do seem like they have lasting value.   I made the wrong call.  Sorry about that.</p>

<p>So, here's what I've done to save the good material.  For two of those three questions, I did radical surgery on the question to get at the conceptual point that the answer is addressing, and I've undeleted those two questions.  Hopefully now they are decent questions that someone might plausibly have again in the future, and that they'll be able to find if so.  You can look at <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/87335/755"">Detect whether one Turing machine invokes another</a> and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/87084/755"">Solving diophantine equations -- does having a bound on the size of the solution help?</a> if you want to review the surgery I did and make further improvements.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/87165/755"">one remaining question</a> that I just don't see value in.  It's a ""please give me feedback on my idea"" question that had lots of symbols but doesn't seem to have any useful content that I could extract, and the answer basically says that.  I don't see much chance that this will be useful to anyone else in the future.  Perhaps you'll see a way to extract a useful interesting question that has a non-trivial answer, and if so great, but I couldn't.  So, I'm going to leave this deleted.  (Caveat: I suspect this link will only be accessible if you have at least 10K reputation, so you might not be able to see the deleted question.)</p>

<p>I hope this sounds like a reasonable resolution.  Thanks for the nudge about this; I'm happier now that we could find a way to save the useful content that you and others wrote.</p>

<p>UX.SE has Balsamiq mockups built-in, since mockups frequently appear as images in questions or answers anyway and it's convenient to have them editable directly in the Q&amp;A interface to avoid copy/pasting images back and forth. For similar reasons LaTeX math markup is enabled on a variety of SE sites.</p>

<p>I work at a <a href=""https://yworks.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">company</a> that specializes in graph drawing and interactive editing of graphs. We do have two interactive graph editor applications, a <a href=""http://www.yworks.com/products/yed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java-based desktop application</a>, and a <a href=""https://www.yworks.com/yed-live/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">browser-based one</a>. I thought it might be nice to have such a capability for drawing graphs directly within questions/answers as well, similar to how Balsamiq mockups is integrated. Looking through posts tagged <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/graph-theory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;graph-theory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">graph-theory</a> that have images there's quite a wide variety in how those are created:</p>

<li>Hand-drawn</li>
<li>Graphviz</li>
<li>Some screenshots from LaTeX-typeset documents</li>
<li>A few drawn in Paint, or Office</li>

<p>I believe many of the images that are not taken from somewhere else (and thus would have been created on the fly for that question/answer) could be comfortably created by such a tool, perhaps with some editing aids specifically aimed at graph types commonly used in this context here.</p>

<p>Just wondering whether such a thing would actually be welcome or considered useful here. Actual integration and creating the editor would be a different problem entirely and maybe the Stack Exchange staff has strong opinions in this regard as well.</p>

I didn't include all my sketches in that answer, for example the image below was not included. I see this as an advantage of a local tool vs an integrated online tool, namely that you keep your artwork locally, even the one which you did not use in the end.</p>

<p>Later I just kept using yEd, because it was so easy to use, even for tasks which were easy enough that other tools could probably have done them just as well, like <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/27828/the-equivalence-relations-cover-problem-in-graph-theory"">here</a> or <a href=""https://gentzen.wordpress.com/2015/11/15/a-canonical-labeling-technique-by-brendan-mckay-and-isomorphism-testing-of-deterministic-finite-automata/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

If you see that happen, and if you think it was a good question and a good answer that's likely to be useful to others in the future, flag it for moderator attention and we can undelete if that seems like the best solution.</p>

  <p>I've already ben able to compress and encrypt each individual file

  thinking maybe to have a hash table of descriptors, where each entry
  would have the following information:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Position (in the binary container)</li>
  <li>Size (to be able read only the bytes for that particular file)</li>
  <li>Type (whether it's a directory or a file)</li>
  <li>Parent</li>
  <li>Next sibling</li>

  <p>Also, if each hash is computed from the full path in the original
  directory, extracting a single file would require only a binary
  search. But for traversing a directory or extracting multiple files,
  the fields for <strong>parent</strong> and <strong>next sibling</strong> in the descriptor could be used

5,"<p>I am interested in learning about what methods are currently considered to be the ""best"" for approximately solving large instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in practice. However, as I began writing a question concerning this I was prompted that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The question you're asking appears subjective and is likely to be closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand why this is a dangerous question to ask. There are many heuristics and meta-heuristics that have been published claiming to efficiently find near-optimal solutions to TSPs, each with their own benefits and drawbacks, and no method is necessarily clearly the best.</p>

<p>However, this is precisely why I'm interested in asking this question: there are so many different methods that exist that it is hard for someone not experienced in the field to truly compare them. Certainly some methods are more highly cited then others, but these methods may have been supplanted more recently by better methods which are less well known.</p>

<p>While the question has no definitive answer, it is not merely a matter of opinion. There are various empirical and theoretical results that can be referenced to justify a particular answer. Even if there is no one definitive answer, I can imagine that answers to the question could be given that would be constructive and helpful to myself and others with an interest in the subject.</p>

<p>Would asking this question be considered on topic in this community? If not, would there be a way of modifying or changing the question to make it more on topic? (For instance, asking for <em>some</em> very good methods for solving the TSP rather than ""<em>the best</em>""?)</p>

<li>too broad and/or</li>

<p>What you want is a <em>literature survey</em>. Stack Exchange is a poor platform for such.</p>

<p>That said, asking for a solution for a <em>specific problem</em> with certain <em>well-defined properties</em> can be a good question, especially if you include your research/attempts (what failed, and why?).</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Don't ask for what's considered to be best.  What's ""considered"" is a matter of an opinion.  Questions that call for opinion usually aren't a good fit here.</p>

<p>Don't ask for the best approach.  What's best is often a matter of opinion.  Often, there are multiple ways you might judge a candidate solution: how fast is it in practice, how good are the theoretical bounds on its complexity, how easy is it to implement, how good are the solutions, how good are the worst-case approximation bounds, how good an approximation does it tend to give on instances of some particular type in practice, and so on.  If you ask for the ""best"" solution you're not giving any indication of what criteria you will use to evaluate solutions.  Instead, identify your requirements or what criteria you will use to evaluate solutions.</p>

<p>I'm not sure you should ask for an overview of an entire field or line of research.  That's probably too much to expect from a single answer here.  Instead, do some research and reading on your own.  Asking someone to summarize all known algorithms or all points in the tradeoff space seems like too much.  Asking about a single point in the tradeoff space feels reasonable to me.</p>

<p>Do do research, and summarize what you have found in the question.  The <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">CSTheory.SE faq</a> has some helpful advice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should only post questions you're actually seriously thinking about. Users are expected to do their part and try to answer their question by themselves before posting them on cstheory and asking for help from others. Search to see if your question is already answered somewhere else (e.g. Wikipedia) before asking a question. Try to make your question interesting for others by providing some background knowledge. Remember, questions should be based on knowledge sharing, not on shirking. Shirking goes against the spirit of the site.</p>

<p>I'm confused as to how this reason applies to my edit. First of all, the edit is intended to help future viewers, not the post's author. Second of all, there is already an over 2 year old comment pointing out the bug so adding another comment seems unlikely to help. Thirdly, adding a separate answer is even worse as the post is very good on the whole - it just needs a minor correction. We have an edit feature, presumably so that we can make improvements to existing answers without bothering the OP.</p>

<p>In this situation does it make sense to reject the edit? And does the reason make sense?</p>

<p>Note: I am avoiding linking the question because I am asking to understand the site, not to have my edit approved.</p>

5,"<p>Assuming that your edit did, in fact, correct a bug in an answer, it was welcome and this rejection reason does not make sense. Edits to <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/editing"">“correct minor mistakes”</a> are encouraged. Thank you!</p>

<p>Without seeing the edit in question and without asking the person who rejected it, it is difficult to know why they picked this rejection reason. They may have made a mistake, or they may have considered your edit too radical.</p>

<p>Some people reject editing as a matter of principle, or because they're used to forums with stronger post ownership where editing is reserved for extreme cases. If you're ever confronted with such people, please point politely them to the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/editing"">policy on editing</a> (which explicitly states “If you are not comfortable with the idea of your contributions being collaboratively edited by other trusted users, this may not be the site for you”).

<p>So when should we use the tag <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lists"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lists&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lists</a>? </p>

<p>I thought it should be used only for the abstract data type meaning because there is already a <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linked-lists"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;linked-lists&#39;"" rel=""tag"">linked-lists</a> tag.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Tl;dr: Both is fine!</p>

<hr>

<p>We have different levels of tags: some, like <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/complexity-theory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;complexity-theory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">complexity-theory</a>, cover entire fields of research; others, like <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rice-theorem"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;rice-theorem&#39;"" rel=""tag"">rice-theorem</a>, relate to a very specific thing.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/814/98"">idea</a> is to always have a little of everything: ""big"" tags to broadly classify the question, and then as many and as specific tags as you can fit in the limit of five.</p>

<p>For instance, I might tag a question that asks about how to implement queues using linked lists as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/data-structures"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;data-structures&#39;"" rel=""tag"">data-structures</a> <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lists"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lists&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lists</a> <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linked-lists"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;linked-lists&#39;"" rel=""tag"">linked-lists</a> <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/queues"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;queues&#39;"" rel=""tag"">queues</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it's more about the algorithm, I might add <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/algorithms"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;algorithms&#39;"" rel=""tag"">algorithms</a>. If there's an analysis aspect to it, I might instead add <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/algorithm-analysis"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;algorithm-analysis&#39;"" rel=""tag"">algorithm-analysis</a>, and maybe drop either of <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lists"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;lists&#39;"" rel=""tag"">lists</a>/<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linked-lists"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;linked-lists&#39;"" rel=""tag"">linked-lists</a> for <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/runtime-analysis"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;runtime-analysis&#39;"" rel=""tag"">runtime-analysis</a>/<a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/space-analysis"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;space-analysis&#39;"" rel=""tag"">space-analysis</a>. As you see, it's not an exact science: when editing, I try to represent the focus or perspective of the question as well as possible. Questions I might ask are:</p>

<ul>
<li>How relevant is it that the lists are (single-)linked?</li>
<li>Is the asker specifically interested in space costs? (The default assumption is runtime, so in that case I'd always add the tag.)</li>
<li>Does the asker already have the algorithm and wants it analysed, or are they looking for an algorithm first? (Then, analysis may be better posted as separate question.)</li>
<li>If it's about an analysis, is it about the worst case (sadly, the default) or <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/average-case"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;average-case&#39;"" rel=""tag"">average-case</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, if I can't decide in which direction to tag, chances are that the question is too broad. If you're asking for queue implementations using <em>both</em> single- and double-linked lists and a comparative analysis of runtime and space in worst and average case -- well, we're looking at a 15-page paper, so that question will have to be split up!</p>

5,"<p>I have a lot of difficulty telling whether or not I have selected a vote on CS stack exchange. The difficult is probably magnified by color blindness (Deuteranomaly, affects 5% of men).</p>

5,"<p>As part of implementing the new unified themes across the network, we're gradually rolling out updated site themes for each site. As of today, we have enabled your updated site theme for testing. </p>

<p>If you can't see it right now, that's by design! This is a very early test implementation of your design and we need your help finding issues with it before we make it live for everyone permanently. So, keep in mind, there will be things that need fixing! We'll address those things as we can.</p>

<p>If you'd like to review it, here's how:</p>

<h2>How do I enable it?</h2>

<p><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/users/preferences"">Click here</a> and check the ""Beta test new themes"" option. This will turn on the new theme for all sites that have one in testing, including this one. <em>Here's <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314542/opt-in-to-beta-testing-new-themes"">more info</a> on how to opt in.</em> You can uncheck the box to revert to the older theme until the site is live for everyone. <strong>Note, while turning it on is immediate, it will take a few minutes to revert to the old view - <em>but it will go through!</em></strong></p>

<h2>What type of feedback do we need?</h2>

<h3>On this post: Bugs related to this site's design elements</h3>

<p>Please help us look for issues/bugs related to the theme design and how we have mapped the old theme to the new. This needs to be done within the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307862/ch-ch-ch-changes-left-nav-responsive-design-themes"">limits of the new unified theme</a>.</p>

<p>This could include colors of sections of the design or text, problems with JavaScript add-ons (if applicable), the logo or top banner appearance or other artwork.</p>

<p>You can also feel free to ask questions about the new layout if you're unsure how to navigate it.</p>

<h3>On Meta Stack Exchange: General concerns about left nav or theming</h3>

<p>There are some things that are definitely changing everywhere and can't really be adjusted on a per-site basis. A few of them include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Top banner is shorter in height, so some artwork has to be adjusted along with some logos.</li>
<li>Left Navigation is active everywhere (but can be collapsed into a menu by visiting your site preferences - <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/311237/284336"">instructions here</a>).</li>
<li>Responsive layout is active, which lets the site adjust as browser widths change - no side scrolling (some pages haven't been updated, yet, though). For now, if you prefer the scrolling, you can disable this by clicking the ""disable responsiveness"" link in the footer.</li>
<li>Many site elements including tags and voting arrows are standardized across the network.</li>
<li>Link underlining is active. In an effort to make links more visible, they are now being underlined.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have concerns or issues regarding the left nav or the overall approach we are taking to theming, then <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310908/live-left-nav-new-theming-and-responsiveness"">this Meta Stack Exchange post</a> is the right place for feedback. </p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, there are some unique design elements like voting arrows and tags that are being standardized in this process. Keeping these custom elements makes our ability to maintain the sites too complex and, while we're very sad to see them go, we're in a difficult position of needing to make the site designs work together so that we can continue to address feature requests and bugs that will make your Q&amp;A experience better.

<h2>What new themes?</h2>

<p>If you're like, ""What the heck are you talking about?"", then you should read the Meta Stack Exchange post entitled <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312365/rollout-of-new-network-site-themes"">Rollout of new network site themes</a> (and maybe the posts it links to for the full background).

<p>Yes, there's the search in the top-nav bar, but that whole bar feels (and is) rather separate from the main page. It's more intuitive to click a little looking glass there to start a search. This would also be more consistent with where the search box appears on search result pages (after committing a search from the top nav):</p>

5,"<p><a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/679/why-are-there-tags-for-programming-languages"">This</a> question asks whether programming language tags such as [java], [c++], or [python] are on topic at CS stack exchange. The answer says that questions about the programming languages themselves may be on topic but questions about writing in those languages aren't.</p>

<p>That answer is 5 years old and while I agree with it in theory, looking at questions with those tags reveals a graveyard of programming questions that should not have been asked here (and generally are very low quality). The top questions tagged [java], [c++], and [python] are generally not specific to one particular language. In the few cases that they are, they would also be fine under more general tags like [programming-languages] or [type-theory] and the language-specific tag seems unnecessary. For each of these tags, the majority of questions have 0 or fewer votes and a large number have negative votes.</p>

<p>I posit that the presence of those tags gives newbies the impression that their programming questions are on topic here. Even if there are theoretically good questions for these tags, in practice these tags are magnets for bad questions. Given the data, do we really think these tags are a net positive for the site?</p>

<p>I have never had this impression and your hypothesis is not consistent with the user interface and with the behaviors that I've observed.</p>

<p>When you're writing a question, the choice of tags comes last, after you've: 1: decided to post on this site; 2: written a title; 3: written the body of your question. How many people would give up at step 4: choose some tags? We don't have data on this, but when you've gone through so much effort, are you going to let the absence of the most obvious tag stop you?</p>

<p>We do have some related data that points to the answer being “no”. Even on Stack Overflow where the tags exists and is obviously a core tag for the site's topic, a sizable minority of askers don't pick a language tag, but some other tag that is less relevant or totally unrelated. For example, as I write, there are 2 non-deleted questions in the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/question2answer""><code>question2answer</code></a> tag — those people have a <em>question to answer</em>. That's just from the past 9 days (older questions are <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/78048/enable-automatic-deletion-of-old-unanswered-zero-score-questions-after-a-year/92006#92006"">likely to be automatically deleted</a> and doesn't include manually-deleted questions. Back when there was a <code>homework</code> tag, a lot of questions got posted with just this tag. Tags like <code>question</code> had to be blacklisted (even though that tag name could make sense for NLP). Here on CS.SE, we get programming questions with tags like <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programming-languages"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;programming-languages&#39;"" rel=""tag"">programming-languages</a>, or just some choice of tag that makes absolutely no sense.</p>

<p>Removing the tags would have no impact on the flow of bad or off-topic questions. It would only make it harder to find questions to which the tags are relevant. So the tags are beneficial to the site.</p>

<p>For example: Should we post comments encouraging users to register?

<p>Stack Exchange does not require registration so we shouldn't infer anything from a user's decision not to register. I suspect that, in this privacy-conscious age, quite a lot of people will be reluctant to register when doing so is optional. Posts should be judged on their own merit, not on whether or not the poster has registered. Even if we feel that unregistered users are more likely to abandon their questions, the question exists for the common good, not just for the user who posted it.</p>

<p>We should also be careful about even encouraging unregistered users to register. As a result of the comment thread that prompted this meta thread, the user whose question was being commented on registered an account. But now they can't edit their own question to improve it...</p>

<p>Unregistered users will often run into problem by not being able to edit their posts, sometimes creating strings of posts. They also don't receive notifications for comments or answers. They can't join chat. They can not vote on answers they may receive.</p>

<p>Anyone is free to decline to answer or curate questions from unregistered users, or questions from users whose name starts with A, or questions from users whose avatar includes more green pixels than blue pixels. That's because everyone is a master of their own time and involvement.</p>

Don't just say ”you should register your account“. Most users don't even know what that means, and even if they knew, they'd have no reason to do what you say. Any comment that says “you should register” must include two pieces of information: <strong>how and why</strong>. For the how, link to <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/creating-accounts"">How do I create an account?
</a> from the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/account"">help center</a>. Note that it doesn't say “register your account”, it says “creating an account”. The terminology around accounts is a bit confusing. For the why, explain how this would solve whatever problem they're having, e.g. that this will allow them to upvote answers (in response to a comment saying ”thanks“).</p>

Since users aren't notified of comments on a deleted posts except for comments left by a moderator shortly before or after deletion, it's usually up to moderators to leave such a comment, but in case the user does visit the site before the answer is deleted, you can speed things up by leaving a comment in addition to flagging.</p>

<p>A comment like “Here comes another unregistered user (I was planning to write an answer...).” is unhelpful because the target wouldn't even understand what you mean. It's also <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/conduct#unacceptable-behavior"">rude</a> because all the target will see is ”I refuse to help you for some obscure reason, even though I would have helped someone else“.

<p><strong>Judge questions on their merit.</strong> Personally, I'd like to judge questions on their merits, rather than by who they are from.  I'm not suggesting this as a policy to enforce on others (how could we?), but rather as a goal that I'd like to aspire to.  Perhaps you might like to join me in those aspirations?</p>

<p><strong>Be constructive.</strong> Let's use comments for material that (a) helps the user improve their post or (b) helps the user.  In other words, let's try to make our comments constructive and helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Respect their decision.</strong>  It's fine to suggest ""You might want to consider registering your account; it helps you make sure you don't miss answers"", but it is ultimately the poster's decision; let's respect their decision, without giving them a hard time.  Let's avoid suggesting ""Please register your account; I am less likely to answer if you don't"" or anything that could feel like pressuring them to register.</p>

<p><strong>Welcoming in public.</strong>  We can (privately) use whatever criteria we want when choosing how to vote and whether to answer.  However, public comments that are visible to the poster and others are held to a higher standard.  I propose we avoid publicly making comments that cast aspersions or negatively judge a post based on whether it is from a registered or unregistered user, or that express frustration with questions from unregistered users, or that imply such questions are somehow less welcome or second-tier, as those could be taken as hostile or unwelcoming.</p>

<p>² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.</p>
<p>³ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 3 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 3, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>
<p>⁴ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes).</p>
<p>⁵ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>
<p>⁶ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).</p>

<p>In particular, is <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/102663/what-algorithm-is-appropriate-for-a-thermostat-controlling-the-heating-of-a-room"">What algorithm is appropriate for a thermostat controlling the heating of a room with floor heating?</a> on-topic?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>If the question is how to model the physics of the environment, I don't think that's on-topic here.</p>

<p>If the question is about methods for controlling the physical environment, I'm not sure.  It will probably depend on whether the question is best answered from a computer science perspective or has been studied by computer scientists.  In some areas (e.g., the US), control theory has been studied in electrical engineering departments rather than in computer science departments, but apparently in other areas (e.g., France), control theory is more closely associated with computer science.  So, it's unclear to me where questions about PID controllers, control theory, and such should fall, but plausibly they could be on-topic here.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/322252/where-can-i-ask-for-algorithm-recommendations"">Where can I ask for algorithm recommendations?</a></p>

<p>And was asked to migrate my question to softrec. here</p>

<p>The thing is, there are only two algorithms, at least that I could find, I don't know whether both are bad, at least for me or whether the dictionaries or implementations are bad.</p>

<p>In any case, I feel like only 2 kind of people can answer my question, either a software engineer working on a language related project or a computer scientist working on research papers related to that subject.</p>

<p>No programming related SE site is willing to recommend algorithms, so I was forced to move it to soft rec, but I feel like it belongs here, I'm afraid to post it though. I'm not looking for an implementation, just an algorithm name. </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Depends.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are you looking for an <em>algorithm</em> -- an abstract thing usually expressed using pseudo code or mathematics -- for you to study or implement including further work?<br>
--> probably ontopic</p>

<p>Or are you looking for a <em>program</em>, that is a ready-made <em>implementation</em> of an algorithm, for you to use in a larger program?<br>
--> definitely offtopic</p></li>
<li><p>Is your question: ""How can I solve this problem at all?""<br>
--> suited; any correct algorithm is a good answer.</p>

<p>Or is it: ""Which of the N algorithms is the best?""<br>
--> usually unsuited for SE since ""best"" is not well-defined. However, if you can describe well what your requirements are, it <em>can</em> work.</p>

<p>Or: ""What are all the algorithms for this problem?""<br>
--> unsuited as <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/640/98"">list question</a> <em>and</em> <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/957/98"">too broad</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You seem to be looking for a <em>program</em>. While you have two options already, you are looking for a <em>list</em> of others that are ""better"" in an unspecified sense. That makes your question unsuited for cs.SE, and indeed most SE sites.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>In your specific situation, I would suggest that you avoid phrasing your question as a request for a recommendation.  Recommendations are subjective, and subjective questions don't work well here.</p>

<p>Instead, if you want it to fit well on this site, state it as a problem that you want solved.  Tell us what your requirements are, or what criteria you will use for evaluating solutions.  Give us some background on what approaches you currently know of, and why they are unsuitable.  Then your question might be suitable.</p>

<p>As a caveat, after all that, it's also possible that it might be unsuitable.  If your question amounts to ""solve this open research problem"", it's probably not reasonable to expect that to happen in response to a question here.  But it's the best shot I can see for taking your question in a direction that is suitable here.</p>

<p>For instance, your criteria might be ""minimize error rate"", or might be ""error rate below 5%"".  If so, say so, and say how you plan to measure error rate.  Then, tell us about what research you've already done.  Summarize each of the approaches you are aware of, and what their error rate is, and why they are unsuitable.</p>

5,"<p>First of all, I don't know if it is appropriate to post this as an answer but I need 50+ reputation points to comment and I have barely been given the rights to post an answer (thank you, Gilles).</p>

<p>Back to the topic on hand. The following is the same question but stripped of its context:</p>

<p>Given a program that outputs a value which varies with time and which can be influenced with a boolean, causing the value to rise if set to true or to fall if set to false, what algorithm would be suitable for anticipating when to switch said boolean to ensure a certain output value at a certain moment in time considering that the rate of change of the output can also vary?</p>

<p>It is the very same question but without 'physical world' aspect. I would assume this question is on topic, at least according to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/165519/where-should-i-post-questions-about-algorithms-stack-overflow-or-software-engin"">this meta answer</a>:</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>Computer Science is scheduled for an election <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/election/2"">next week, January 21st</a>. In connection with that, we will be holding a Q&amp;A with the candidates.  This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The purpose of this thread was to collect questions for the questionnaire. The questionnaire is now live, and you may find it <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1592/2018-moderator-election-qa-questionnaire"">here</a>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike the <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1055/2015-moderator-election-qa-question-collection"">previous election back in 2015</a>, this time the Q&amp;A question collection will be provided one week in advance of the actual elections. This will allow users some extra time to evaluate their decision on whether to nominate, as well as let them provide answers to the questionnaire during the nomination phase itself.</p>

<p>Here's how it'll work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Until the nomination phase, (so, until Monday, January 21st at 20:00:00Z UTC, or 3:00 pm EST on the same day, give or take time to arrive for closure - it is a company holiday as well), this question will be open to collect potential questions from the users of the site. Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post <em>one question per answer</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>If your question contains a link, please use the syntax of <code>[text](link)</code>, as that will make it easier for transcribing for the finished questionnaire.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at currently.</p></li>
<li><p>At the start of the nomination phase, the Community Team will select <strong>up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community</strong> provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. </p></li>
<li><p>Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, typically containing 10 questions in total.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&amp;A.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions or feedback about this process, feel free to post as a comment here.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Here is a set of general questions, gathered as very common questions asked every election.

<p>I definitely agree that we should have a single tag name to refer to representations of integers. But maybe we should have a different name for representations of floating point numbers? And what about other kinds of numbers (I could only find <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/45076/compressing-rationals-given-error-bounds"">one</a> question about exact arithmetic on rationals)?</p>

<p>Regarding the choice of primary tag name, it's usually a good idea to align with Wikipedia. If there's a debate to be had about naming, they've usually gone through it and we might as well not redo the debate here. Furthermore using the same terminology on major websites makes things easier to find for people. Wikipedia has an article “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">numeral system</a>” about mathematical representations of integers, which is not exactly the same thing as representations inside computers, and an article “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_number_format"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">computer number format</a>” which covers integers, exact non-integers and floating point.</p>

<p>Rationale: While @Gilles notes that the tag <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/numerical-representations"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;numerical-representations&#39;"" rel=""tag"">numerical-representations</a> is almost exclusively about representing integers and the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/number-formats"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;number-formats&#39;"" rel=""tag"">number-formats</a> is about even on integers vs floats, I think this distinction better made clear by adding other tags, such as <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/binary"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;binary&#39;"" rel=""tag"">binary</a> or <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/floating-points"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;floating-points&#39;"" rel=""tag"">floating-points</a>.</p>

<p>As for the name, Wikipedia uses <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_number_format"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Computer number format""</a> for this topic. The 'computer' part is redundant for this site, so 'number formats' is a name for which the meaning should be clear.</p>

5,"<p>I've just created a question and tried to add a tag ""cubical-type-theory"", but my keyboard is problematic and causes the tag to be ""cubical--type-theory"" (with an unexpected <code>-</code>).</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>There's very little to worry about here: just create the new, correct tag. The old one, if unused, will be cleaned up by the system after a while. (I went ahead and fixed the spelling.)</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>Normally, if you've just created a tag, you can rename it by editing the question(s) that have it to remove the misspelled tag name and adding the correct tag name. There's no way to explicitly delete the old tag name, but once a tag is not present on any question, it will disappear after a day or so (there's a daily cleanup job).</p>

<p>If the tag is already present on many questions, that would be a different matter requiring a meta discussion. If the outcome of the discussion is to rename the tag, moderators have a tag renaming tool that doesn't bump questions.</p>

<p>There's an exception: if the old name and the new name differ only in the placement of hyphens or in a final <code>s</code>, the system will prevent you from creating the new name. This is because of a general rule that prevents having two tags that differ only in the placement of hyphens or a tag that looks like the plural of another. That's why you were referred to meta. In this case (missing hyphen, misplaced hyphen, extra hyphen), since the fix is clear and doesn't need community discussion, you can flag and ask a moderator to do the renaming.</p>

5,"<p>2019 is here! And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of <strong>Community Promotion Ads</strong>! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>relevant blogs and websites about computer science</li>
<li>computer science events, conferences, or meetups</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1582"">here</a>.</p>

<p>If the question is truly nonsensical, there must be a reason why. Assuming the commenter did not write something such that I can clearly see that it is indeed nonsensical, I will ask the commenter to explain such that I can understand the problem with the question. I will not interfere unless someone can convince me that the question is nonsense or someone can convince me it is fine. (If the community has e.g. closed the question while I wait, so be it, apparently they know more than I do)</p>

<p>Note that I want the commenter to provide 'evidence' for their claims and not the asker. The main reason here is practical: the commenter should know a bit how this site works and would likely be much more capable of deciding what is close-worthy or what not. Often, askers on such questions are new and do not yet know what is clear or on-topic.</p>

<p>Of course, if the comment chain becomes too big or cluttered, moving part to chat would a good idea; and if people are not being nice or not constructive, we should address that as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>What is your take on ""problem dumps"", ""check my work"" and ""hint-only answers"", respectively?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>""Problem dumps"" are possibly nice exercises, but asked in a form that is most unhelpful for the student asking them. Obviously, just giving them the answer is not very helpful and sets a bad precedent. I think the best approach here is to request them to show their work. If they don't do so (often, they don't even have any interaction beyond posting the question), I just ignore the question. I advise others to do the same, but they are free to answer if they feel like it, even if that doesn't help the student asking the question.</p>

<p>""Check my work"" is reasonable question, but simply a bad fit for this platform. I think the best is to explain in a comment that this is the case and request the asker to transform it into a question we can actually provide a decent answer to. Again, if the user does not reply or someone decides to answer it is not ideal in my opinion, but people are free to act that way.</p>

<p>For ""hint-only answers"", my main take is that if your hint is so large that it does not fit into a comment, it is not a very good hint. I recommend not posting a hint as an answer. One reason is that hints are hard to evaluate: how do I know whether a certain hint solves the asker's problem? How should I vote for them? How do we compare them with answers that actually solve the question and not give hints? Another is that it discourages actual answers, which in some cases are reasonable to give. I would be pretty let down if I was searching for a solution of some problem and found a cs.se page with my problem in the question, where the only answer was some vague hint I don't get.</p>

<p>Things get a bit more tricky when the asker explicitly asks for a hint, rather than a solution. I would still prefer to have the hints in the comments (and not have an answer at all), but I would not bother people who decide to give the hint in an answer, since that is what is explicitly asked for.</p>

<p>All these terms are related to the broader concept of homework, so let me finish by noting that those who answer questions on cs.se are not obliged to solve your homework for you. They would rather do something else if you do not cooperate: note that we are free to '<a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1156"">do as we please</a>'.</p>

  <ol start=""3"">

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>""User moderation"". That is, the challenge is to handle the incoming stream of questions mainly through moderation by privileged users. To see what I mean, have a look at <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1557/2018-a-year-in-moderation"">2018: a year in moderation</a> and check out the following row:</p>

<pre><code>Questions closed     1,180        595
</code></pre>

<p>This means twice as many questions are closed by moderators as by regular users. If you look at the same row of similar reports of other SE sites, you will find that this is really uncommon. </p>

<p>What does this mean? It means that the community cannot express their opinion on what is on or off-topic by themselves, but has to rely on moderators to do so. This is not ideal, since moderators should be there to handle exceptions where regular users are ill fit to decide, not handle the routine. Of course, this also means more work for the moderators, which they would rather spend on other ways to maintain the site.</p>

<p>Since we are looking at 'challenges' for this site, lets try to generalize. What I mentioned here is only a symptom of the underlying problem. Who can actually vote to close? Any user with at least 3k reputation. On this site, there are about 69 users with enough reputation. However, not all of them are very active in their interaction with new questions. From what I can see in comments, we have a ~10 user core of >3k users that interact a lot with new questions, about 10 >3k users that interact consistently on new questions with tags within their specialty and a lot users with less than 3k rep. Note that most questions do get a lot interaction from the community, but there simply are too few users actually consistently closing questions to easily get 5 close votes even on 'obviously' close-worthy questions.</p>

<p>When I look at >3k rep users, there is one thing that jumps out at me: most of them are 'old', in the sense that they have been around here for quite a while <em>and</em> that I barely see them doing anything on newly asked questions. It isn't easy to get 3k rep on here. It surely is <em>possible</em> to get 3k rep in a relatively soon-ish time, but it requires answering a lot questions in relatively little time. Not an investment many people can make. </p>

<p>To make a long story short, I think that user-moderation on this site is currently 'broken' and I believe the cause is simply that too few active users have enough reputation, which may be caused by the fact that getting 3k rep here is hard. This is the challenge. </p>

<p>Now, for a <em>solution</em>, I have do not have a clear idea. However, there are multiple options that can be more or less handled concurrently:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Raise the issue on meta and ask for reasons why people do or do not help with moderation.</p></li>
<li><p>I can try to contact high rep users that aren't very active in moderation tasks to ask them to do more.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to encourage the community to upvote more often, such that 3k reputation is easier to reach. </p></li>
<li><p>I could try to ask SE to change the reputation required for certain priviliges (I highly doubt they will do this, but if they would, it could work.)</p></li>
</ul>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that I am the author of this question, so let me first give you my honest opinion: I have no idea and it would probably depend a lot on the specific issue at hand. </p>

<p>However, I can think of a few things that might be good to do, so let me discuss that here. The first step is to see whether we have a problem. This can be done by asking users directly in a meta thread, inspecting unwanted behaviour that gets reported via flags, or other inefficiencies that reach your mod-sensors somehow. If I think we have a problem (I would probably first discuss this with other moderators), I should do something, if not, I shouldn't do anything.</p>

<p>Given that I think some consensus is nessecary, starting a discussion on meta would be the best way to proceed. Hopefully, we can reach some consensus there and then it is simply a case of 'enforcing' whatever was decided by reminding users who do not act according to the new policy. If we cannot reach a workable consensus on meta, I think I must conclude that the 'medicine' may be worse than the disease and leave it at that. At least we know why we do things differently. </p>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>First, lets see if there is some established policy on the matter, time to search meta. This has been discussed before, but it doesn't look very conclusive. Ok, so lets see what is reasonable. First of all, I'd say the responsibility of not letting participants of a contest cheat by asking others is the problem of the organizers of the contest, not ours. But, I do not think it is unreasonable to delete the question until the contest has finished (assuming the contest finishes within reasonable time limit, a week/month or so.) After that, I see no reason to keep it deleted, so I can undelete it at that point.</p>

<p>As for sending identifying information, it is not my job to play internet detective either. This seems a bit unreasonable and if the user was only slightly clever, they can easily have a different email, name and even IP-address than whatever is known to the contest organizers. Also, I'm not sure if I am even legally allowed to disclose this information. So, I will ask them to ask that to SE staff and they will probably tell them that they won't give them this info (I assume). In any case, handing over personal data of users here is not my decision to make as a moderator.</p>

<p>I have contributed quite a lot to helping new users clarify their questions and helped maintaining the quality of new questions, mostly using the various queues to see where I can do something.

<p>If the decision was minor, I will simply leave it be, people are allowed to have different opinions. If, however, I notice a pattern or see that people disagree on a topic I think is important, I think it is good to see why there is a disagreement. I think I would roughly take the same strategy as in my answer to question 4, where I additionally hope to at least understand those who disagree with me. If it turns out the community also sees or understands my point but still disagrees, then so be it, I will do what the community wants.</p>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I did have a rather heated argument in chat about a year ago. It never escalated to bans or (threats to/warnings of) suspensions, but my behaviour was claimed to be at least nonconstructive by some (although I cannot recall whether this included moderators).
I will not go into the details here (because I forgot most of them, and because that isn't the point), I think it is enough detail if I say that I strongly disagreed with certain moderation actions of another (non-moderator) user and suggested that they do that. It quickly became clear other users did not agree with my opinion and severely disliked my suggestion, which led to the argument.</p>

<p>What I learned from this is the following: at the time, I did not understand why people reacted as such: I was reasonably polite and wanted to have a normal discussion about this topic, I did not understand why people claimed I was not polite and did not want to discuss this topic, but only declare their opinion. </p>

<p>Now, I do understand the reaction, or at least the discrepancy between my experience and that of others. In the end, what matters is not how you say things, but what you say. Sure, cursing like a sailor is unlikely to give sympathy, but not doing that is just a baseline. So, neither my perception of my behaviour, nor did my actual behaviour mattered: sometimes, people really don't like what you're actually saying and take offense at that.</p>

<p>If I see a user in the same situation, then I see a user that has somehow managed to say something that is universally disliked by some group. I will first try to see if I can understand that users' position. If it is a reasonably coherent position, I will try to first mention to the user that I <em>understand</em> their position (even though I may not <em>agree</em> with it) and then proceed with general de-escalation tactics. (telling people to stop discussing things or at least to cool down, chat-suspend if they don't listen to that etc.)</p>

<p>Then, we wait. If the user behaves themselves, then great, problem solved. If not, then warn the user that such behaviour is not tolerated and explain that there are rules and being an active contributor does not mean you do not have to follow the rules.</p>

<p>If the troublesome behaviour persists even after that, treat the users like a 'regular troublemaker': have a stern talking-to, warn them, suspend them and such.</p>

If I think that, after this explanation, that they have a policy I disagree with or still do not understand completely and is not confirmed to be desirable by the community, I will explain the general matter on meta and ask the community for their input, such that we can make clearer policy and the moderators do what the community wants.</p>

<p><em>Innocent until proven guilty</em>: I start with assumption that the question makes sense. With this I start to gather second opinion, ask OP to reformulate problem, with hope that other wording would help, ask for clarification and commenter to give details. Then if this doesn't help I ask community to cast votes, make edit if possible (perhaps some third party also know this field), ask about it at meta. Then, if this does not yield results, I would like to chat with both asker and commenter to work something out (because at that point, only these two know about topic and are responsive), asking commenter to support claim and asker to let others to help, by tuning question. In spare time I would also like to investigate topic, check something about this field, get some basics.

</blockquote>

<p><strong>I am against problem dumps</strong>. These help nobody, asker gets credit for cheating, people waste time, and in the end everyone loses. These are mainly time-wasters, people cheated, want more, and more and it starts to pollute site with exercises, without real pedagogical or technical value (otherwise the question is salvageable). People that decide not to put any effort to it very often starts passive aggression in comments, so problem should be treated efficiently.
<strong>“check my work” is off-topic here.</strong> Period.
“hint-only answers” well, answer box is not called “hint box” for some reason.  <strong>Straight no.</strong>
It is very nice of asker to state that this is a homework, and they want hint, put effort, and finish on their own. A big plus for being honest, but we have our standards, our policy.
There was no consensus at meta about hint only answers for long time, but there is <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1033/towards-a-policy-for-hint-only-answers"">fresh meta post</a>. I sign under Raphael's answer. We do not want hint only answers. Comment now and answer later or spoiler format are good compromise, with accordance to our policy. Although there is a general dislike for homework, let us be honest, many questions are, but we are not obliged to check if this is assignment, but there is quite good correlation between H.A. and bad question.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The biggest problem is inconsistency. Some users answer and upvote homework, some downvote and close them. It is personal choice, but for newcomers and people accustomed to other forums, it gives very bad image. It takes a while to get into SE format, but our expectations are also hard for people from outside. On the one hand homework are not welcome, but if there is effort, someone will help. We are against open contests, but it is not ours duty to search internet for active cheating occasions. Our newcomers should read whole help centre and get consequences of not knowing them, but also we lose them some slack. People would answer some less fortunate questions, but do not want to be downvoted, for otherwise good answer. We also would like review queue to be empty, but there are not enough people eligible to vote, also everyday same problem arise.</p>

<p>What can be done?
Ask peoples for help, vote, remind our standards. If some policy is not ready yet, gather to discuss one. I do not think that enforcing rules that people do not agree with is healthy, but every day users do moderate on their own, by actions and tools, so another way is to stop splitting community, enabling polarization of views by enabling broader moderation to community. I opt for either lowering the number of voters in queues or lowering the rep limits (I agree on this one with Discrete lizard, from a bit different perspective).</p>

<p>This one was touched in previous answer, I agree with author of this question, that problem exists. Meta debate/discussion comes into mind. I respect all sides, yet still we need some consistency, otherwise it looks too chaotic, maybe even unreliable, so saying out loud what is the take, what are hidden assumptions and how can we get to consensus, saving a lot of work and frustration. Hopefully something will work out and reveal and even if remedy is not found, at least some milestones towards consensus or understanding would.

About sending identifying information. <strong>Plain no.</strong> I do not send personal, identifying data ever. Period. If “plain no” does not suffice, I am not a lawyer, I do not know what laws sending personal data breaks, so I will not do it if one would ask ;), but I assume that such request should come from binding court order, but this is certainly not the case.</p>

<p>I use all moderation tools available for me all the time. Currently I am the second top reviewer of all time in: Close votes and First posts, third in Low quality posts and Suggested Edits and Reopen Votes, fourth in Late Answers. I have started moderation about September 2015. For some time now, learning what community wants, what are policies and community feeling about certain types of posts, improved. So I probably may say that I moderate to extent of what is possible.<br>
I ask for clarification, for used resources, suggest improvements to question if sit eems fine to me but not to others (this is thankfully very rare case) and hint to convert comment into asnwer (also very rare case).<br>
Important point here is that if I get elected, I will increase my threshold, and adjust because afaik the vote is binding. I will continue to learn from community to follow peoples will.</p>

<p>It really should be handled on a case by case basis. What flags, what arguments, are flags valid, are arguments about meritorious issues or direct and open name-calling?
Firstly I would remind our “be nice policy”, ask to cool down heated argument both sides. If comments are fruitless, I would simply delete conversation and write comment about deletion, ask to stay calm. I think that at this site so much as warning in comment or even reminder from some user really suffices. In case it does not I would privately ask user about motivation, why he ends up in so many arguments, try to understand his point of view, suggest to cool down a bit and remind that collaboration in current world wins over lone star. It also depends on flag types, if these are offensive, I would delete comments and warn him about consequences of recurring behaviour. If this does not stop, there are moderation tools to work accordingly.
Question seems to imply that we value user because of great content so situation mayhap is tricky. It is not. Abusive behaviour is not to be tolerated, in that case mine negligence would be even worse than this user's behaviour.</p>

<p>If this is first time and action is reversible by community, I would observe the reaction. Another one I would ask privately what was motivation behind this decision, where it came from (policy, personal belief, general community behaviour in similar cases). If there is no policy, no general agreement, then we should work that one on meta. If there is no particular, consistent rule (I take it as hypothetical, I do not believe it is possible) I would consult it with other moderators, since they not reacted, I probably have to adjust and understand premise. In other cases I ask community on meta.</p>

5,"<p>In the past week, it has happened twice that questions I have answered have been deleted, but I was unable to see them in the moderator tools. <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/103624/infinite-sequence-has-m-consecutive-digits-regular-languages"">One question</a> I was able to find (and attempt to undelete) via my cell phone, the other is still missing.</p>

<p>What is happening? Is this a bug or a feature?</p>

<p>In particular, a few hours ago I answered an interesting question about the density of regular languages containing the language of all squares. Now the question has vanished from sight, and I am unable to find any mention on it, although I both edited it and answered it. I suspect that this was a homework question, and the OP wanted to hide the fact that they got the answer on the web.</p>

<p>This kind of behavior is unacceptable, and I am especially disheartened by the stackexchange platform cooperating with it. Should I open a dummy account and upvote all my answers to prevent them from being deleted?</p>

<p>As a concrete feature, if a question I answered got deleted, shouldn't I, at the very least, get notified so that I can vote to undelete it?</p>

As per the question in the book, you are in fact meant to return a <em>new</em> array, and not modify the original one.</p>

I incorporated this answer into my question as an example of an insufficient solution alongside my own one, which had difference complexity characteristics.

5,"<p>A <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/104176/steps-that-guarantees-to-solve-a-maze"">question</a> that was asked recently concerns synchronizing words. Apparently it had been assumed to be on a different and much more trivial topic, graph traversal, and as a result, entertained a shower of downvotes. The people who downvoted this rather short question, not bothering to read its five lines carefully enough, are probably not going to come back and apologize.</p>

<p>How do we discourage such behavior? Who protects the people who ask questions?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>First of all, I agree with you that downvotes on questions that are fine after minor improvements should be avoided. It is better to close vote/flag instead and even better to edit to improve the question or help the asker do so with a constructive comment. </p>

<p>But I don't think trying to discourage people to downvote is the solution. I think it is better to acknowledge that looking for the best in posts that are usually rather poor requires a lot of patience, which not everyone can muster. This does not justify this behaviour, but it might <em>explain</em> it a bit. Also note that mistakes will happen even if everyone perfectly agrees, so there is no way to completely prevent these situations.</p>

<p>So, what can we do? I have a few ideas:</p>

<h2>Provide more guidance to reviewers</h2>

<p>Most of the questions vulnerable to being misunderstood appear in the first posts review queue. If anyone should 'protect' those who ask these questions it should be first posts reviewers. In this case 'protect' means to improve the quality of the post and/or be generally supportive of the asker. </p>

<p>Approaching reviewers can be done in multiple ways, we could make a meta post where we can point them to, mention in comments if they can improve or use chat for a more individual approach. </p>

<h2>Upvote more</h2>

<p>A lot questions seem to receive at most 3 upvotes during their active period. This means that one or two downvotes have a lot of impact on the post score. If questions receive more votes, the impact of 'bad' downvotes decreases.</p>

<p>The problem here of course is how to achieve this. However, it doesn't take many people to upvote questions. Maybe <em>you</em> (yes, you there, reading this) should upvote more?</p>

<h2>Close more</h2>

<p>This is just speculation, but one reason why people choose to downvote instead of flagging to close could be that questions do not get closed quickly. This means that, from their viewpoint, flagging has almost no effect even after waiting for a while, while close-votes have immediate effect.</p>

<p>Note that I could be wrong here and that questions put on hold are more likely to get more downvotes, but this is something we can consider.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I didn't see the question you mentioned before, but when coming across a problem dump I am quite often guilty of voting to close and usually downvoting as well, without leaving a comment. Nevertheless, I try to sense whether the question really is a verbatim copy (in that case, I don't have much sympathy), or whether the questioner is more genuinely asking a ""real"" question but just is unaware of the practices of the site. In that case, I am almost always too lazy to paste one of the standard answers we have, but try to ask for clarification.</p>

<p>I try my best to view the site as a dynamic beast, meaning that I understand that edits are made, external links might die, better answers might pop up (so the accepted answer can change as well), and so on. So if I (or anyone) has downvoted a question or an answer and it gets improved later on, I try to notice that and then ask myself ""OK, in its current form, is the question/answer worthy of a downvote?"". If not, I upvote.</p>

<p>The above is my just my ideal, and the site certainly doesn't always make it easy to notify you about such changes. On the other hand, new questions stay within the first two pages for a bit of time, making it more likely that I return as well. But I very much sympathize and agree with the point you have raised. Downvoting is perfectly appropriate (and should not be taken as a personal attack, although it can easily feel as such for a new user), but at the same time we should be willing to reconsider our votes if the question/answer is improved.</p>

<p>So definitely, <strong>upvote more if any question/answer deserves that</strong>. Downvoting can also be appropriate, but please also <strong>try to be willing to reconsider your opinion later, don't use it to punish a user for making mistake</strong>. At the time of the writing, the question you linked still has one downvote, which the downvoter might be happy to remove if alerted to it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/103137/if-there-is-comparison-between-two-variables-then-language-is-not-regular-then"">If there is comparison between two variables then language is not regular. Then how the below two languages L1 and L2 Regular? Please Explain</a></p>

<p>It is closed as a duplicate of our reference question for regular languages. However, in my (and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/103137/if-there-is-comparison-between-two-variables-then-language-is-not-regular-then#comment220663_103137"">Apass.Jack's</a>) opinion, it is not a duplicate. Basically, the solution includes two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Show the language is equivalent to <span class=""math-container"">$\{a^t\mid t\ge 1\}$</span> (or <span class=""math-container"">$\ge 2$</span>, whatever).</p></li>
<li><p>Show <span class=""math-container"">$\{a^t\mid t\ge 1\}$</span> is regular. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, Part 1 is the (relatively) tricky part (we can see in the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/103137/if-there-is-comparison-between-two-variables-then-language-is-not-regular-then#comment220661_103137"">comment</a> that OP is indeed confused with this part), while our reference question only deals with Part 2.</p>

<p>Of course, this question itself may not be a good question. First, it may be too simple, and second, the OP shows no effort. However, neither should be a close reason:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the ""too simple"" issue, see <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/86043/introduce-a-general-reference-close-reason/88521#88521"">Introduce a  &quot;general reference&quot; close reason</a>.</li>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>Tl;dr: I stand by my comment there: the question is a problem dump.</p>

<p>We have long since been distinguishing between ""asks a comprehensible question but didn't include own effort"" (--> comment, downvote) and ""copy-paste of exercise problem, no own question"" (--> close as unclear). While it can be argued that this one falls in the border area (we get a hint on the OP's tought process: ""If there is comparison between two variables then language is not regular"") I still think it was reasonable to close (2 regular users + 1 mod, then).</p>

<p>I note that the OP did not make any effort to improve their question, nor did anybody else. Instead, the OP attempted to enter a coaching session in the comments, which is not a good use of the platform.</p>

<p>I currently do not see a reason to re-open. If you think there is a meaningful question there (item 1 in your proposed interpretation, maybe?) that is not covered by the reference questions, please edit the question into shape and then flag for reopening.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I am still not convinced about the question after edit being proper. When I cast vote it looked like problem dump and dupe. Only after comments it become obvious that OP had some unvocalized problem in mind.</p>

<p>After edit I have left a comment with proposal to state parts that that differ this from duplicate, but without further response. Now I see it is not exactly dupe and effort was put to it, but we have come to consensus that comment based coaching with question changing is not good to us.</p>

<p>With a bit follow up (putting underlaying question to body of the post) I will gladly cast reopen vote.</p>

<p>I have expected one more edit (to gather comments and state fully fledged post) and reopen from queue, but it didn't get that far.</p>

<p>Effort is orthogonal to problem: it looks like dupe, after edit it is not fully articulated question and somehow momentum was lost. Now lack of interest mildly suggests dump.</p>

<p>I strongly dislike improvements against OP's will, as it results in reccuring pop up at main page by Community bot.</p>

5,"<p>You do not directly lose reputation because you answered a question and the asker's account gets deleted. You only lose reputation in two cases: if the account that cast an upvote or an accept vote on your post gets deleted, or if your upvoted post gets deleted.</p>

<p>If the account that cast a vote is removed, the vote is removed. This helps limit vote inflation on old posts: to a small extent, it privileges content that remains relevant (and thus keeps getting upvotes) over the years. This is also necessary to prevent fraud: if orphan votes remained around, this would make it easy to create temporary accounts to upvote the same post multiple times or to upvote many posts of the same user without leaving traces.</p>

<p>If the post that deserves a vote is deleted, it's even more clear-cut. A user's reputation only depends on content that's actually on the site, not on content that was on the site in the past.</p>

<p>In both cases, there are exceptions, but the exceptions are just that: exceptions. In the normal case, you don't keep reputation conferred by a vote that is no longer present on the site.</p>

5,"<p>I don't understand the terminology in your help center. And so want to know if this is on-topic or if you know if my potential questions would be better answered elsewhere.</p>

<p>I contribute to Code Review which allows performance and complexity requests. Normally I can figure out some way to improve performance, however sometimes I can't but would like to know how. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/215626"">This question</a> is a brute-force solution to find the best combination of items to eat. It is possible to improve the performance from an algorithm point of view. (As shown in my answer, and another)</li>
<li><a href=""https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/148041"">This question</a> used a brute-force solution to find the amount of unique permutations to a nucleotide. It was possible to find a purely mathematical solution to the problem.</li>
<li>I have my own problem that I've found a brute-force solution, but can't figure out a better solution. Fundamentally it boils down to:

<blockquote>
  <p>You have some curves, <span class=""math-container"">$C$</span>, they all exhibit the following properties:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Range(<span class=""math-container"">$\mathbb{N}$</span>): [0,1]</li>
  <li>Domain(<span class=""math-container"">$\mathbb{Z}$</span>): [0, 99]</li>
  <li>Increasing: <span class=""math-container"">$C_{i} \le C_{j}$</span> when <span class=""math-container"">$i \le j$</span></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><br>
  Given <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> levels(<span class=""math-container"">$\mathbb{Z}$</span>) and <span class=""math-container"">$5$</span> curves find the highest sum of these curves where the domain total the levels.</p>
  
  <p>If there were two curves it would mathematically be: <span class=""math-container"">$i + j = n$</span>, find <span class=""math-container"">$\max{C_{1.i} + C_{2.j}}$</span>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Would highlighting the problem and a solution in English/pseudocode, and asking for improvements to the solution be on-topic here?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Yes, such a question would be on-topic. It falls under “algorithms”, which is an important concept in computer science. Some major areas of computer science around algorithms are looking for algorithms to accomplish a certain task, looking for better algorithms (faster, more resilient, etc.), proving properties of algorithms, analyzing the complexity of algorithm.</p>

<p>The main thing related to algorithms that would be off-topic here is implementing an algorithm in a programming language.</p>

<p>Even if your question is on-topic, you need to make sure that it's answerable. If your problem comes from some applied field, you should explain application-specific concepts in generic mathematical terms. In the fragment you posted, what do you mean by “Range(<span class=""math-container"">$\mathbb{N}$</span>): [0,1]” — range of what? Why are there two sets here? Same questions about the domain. What is a curve in this context, and what does it mean to add them? What does “<span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> levels(<span class=""math-container"">$\mathbb{Z}$</span>)” mean? What does “the domain total the levels” mean?</p>

<p>When asking about performance, it's important to specify the order of magnitude of the values you're interested in. I think you did that with “[0,1]” and “[0,99]” but I'm not sure because I don't understand what these numbers refer to. Also, if there are multiple parameters, be sure to specify which parameter(s) you're optimizing for, and if applicable what constraints apply (e.g. memory vs performance compromise).</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Those things are ontopic, but you have to be careful to post an answerable question. </p>

<p>""What is the most efficient algorithm for this problem?"" is usually more of a research prompt without clear-cut best answers (since there are many cost measures to choose from) and frequently <em>no answer</em> (since lower bounds are hard to come by). Asking for a ""better"" algorithm has similar problems, and admits near-trivial answers.</p>

<p>Ask for an algorithm with specific, well-defined properties. Try to lay out why you think such an algorithm should exist, and tell us about approaches you tried without success.</p>

5,"<p>I don't use this stack exchange much or at all, but I have experience over several years using other stack exchanges. I recently answered a several year old question with an answer.

The relevant question is <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/33794/compute-a-max-flow-from-a-min-cut"">here</a>.</p>

<p>My core question is, how does one report a moderator in this stack exchange for suspected voter fraud (either through self promotion or other means?) I imagine if I have observed this behavior on this stack exchange, I am not the first one to, but I may be the first one to raise it.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>First, let me clarify one point you made:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shortly after, that comment received 3 up-votes in quick succession, after years of being dormant. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Questions that receive a new answer get bumped to the front page. While on large sites such as SO, this does not give a question much attention, on CS.SE, we get on the order of ~50 questions that are bumped to the frontpage daily. So, I do not find it surprising that at least 3 people have seen Raphael's comment.</p>

<p>I do not understand what part of what has happened you consider to be 'voter fraud'. On SE, voter fraud means that one purposefully up/down-votes questions not based on the merits of the post, but e.g. to 'hurt' the poster. There are automated systems in place to detect these practices, although these can only detect relatively 'large scale' fraud.</p>

<p>Voting fraud in general is also something moderators cannot do much with. Site moderators cannot see who voted what. I do not know who casted the downvotes on your answer. Only SE staff can see that.</p>

<p>That said, if you indeed believe a moderator has done voting fraud, or have any issue with the moderators of a particular site, you should <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/contact"">contact</a> SE staff and explain your issue to them. </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>If you take a look at Tom van der Zanden answer, it follows setting given in the question. It looks like expected answer, so some people thought that it is not good enough to change rules ans answer to changed setting. (this is how downvotes work).</p>

<p>For once, you can imagine that result was given to you, and now question is could you use that information, explicitly stated that running anything else is not solution seeked. Question got bumped, explanation was given and due to that 2 downvotes appear (not mine, I do not do downvotes).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I beg to differ. From a practical perspective, you would never compute a min-cut without computing additional information (such as that in the PR algorithm.) <strong>From a theoretical perspective it might be nice to consider things in isolation as you say.</strong> Context is key here.</p>

<p>That is exactly the key point here, expected answer shall be in theoretical perspective in isolation and you have given <strong>practical</strong> one.</p>

<p>Voting fraud is something else, say someone creates multiple accounts to gather upvotes.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I would like to know whether there is some kind of consensus or policy, what to do.  </p>

<p>AFAIK such questions are off-topic here, because this is Q&amp;A and not peer review, many posts fall into ""check my proof"" or ""why this is not solution"". I have seen comments, that this is not proper place for scientific advancements and in my opinion there is no chance for breakthrough here.</p>

<p>I am puzzled, because questions ""where is error in my attempt"" seem to be good, but very similar questions with different wording get downvoted and closed. Posts with hidden attempt to prove get closed.</p>

<p>Is there any hard rule? If not, could we create one?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>First of all, if we would like to have a specific rule against such questions, I don't think it is useful to make the topic &quot;P vs NP&quot; part of that rule. I don't believe we are being flooded by questions about that topic and I don't think that that topic is inherently
'problematic', nor that it is within the domain of research. (That is, questions about the open question (and how to deal with the fact that we don't have an answer) are central to the field of complexity, which permeates to all sorts of 'CS experts')</p>
<p>I think I agree mostly with <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/652/65339"">this answer</a>, although that has bit of a different focus. However, the following two reasons to distinguish good from bad questions on this topic mentioned there are relevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>they are honestly phrased as people trying to understand what they are missing,</p>
</li>
<li><p>they are rather short, have a few points, and are easy to answer for an expert in complexity theory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I think point 2 is key here. There's quite a difference between someone asking to check their 40 page proof versus someone wondering why an elementary proof of 4 lines doesn't solve this open problem.</p>
<p>Point 1 seems more a case of etiquette than a meaningful property of the question. So what if someone really their crisp and clear 4 line proof of P=NP is correct? As long as the question is clear and they behave themselves (in particular when proven wrong), I do not see why this makes the question bad.</p>
<p>A more relevant criterion, that also focuses more on the question, rather than on the user is</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>the question contains a cleanly phrased, well-formed proof based on standard terminology</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this covers all cases of questions we do not want that are excluded by point 1. Point 1 seems to be aimed at 'cranks' that are prone to long, vague proofs littered with (often undefined) non-standard terminology. The long part is already covered by point 2, the vague and non-standard terminology is covered here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... this is not peer review, [...] this is [the] not proper place for scientific advancements and in my opinion there is no chance for breakthrough here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this not the proper place for scientific advancements? Well..., why not? But more to the point, I do not think 'scientific advancements' is the value of the good questions about these topics. The value is that these wrong proofs often make assumptions that are unfounded, but seem very intuitive. (the mother of all assumptions is of course, &quot;clearly, we cannot do better than brute force&quot; such as in <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/86275/"">this question</a>) It just so happens to be the case that the central questions in complexity have remained open problems for a long while, despite appearing relatively simple. It is good for e.g. a student to be aware of that.</p>
<p>Put more poignantly, the error in these proofs is often educational, even for others than the one that has written the proof.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am puzzled, because questions &quot;where is error in my attempt&quot; seem to be good, but very similar questions with different wording get downvoted and closed. Posts with hidden attempt to prove get closed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand your confusion, allowing questions on (complete) P vs. NP proofs seems counter to the policy of not checking peoples answer. I think that point 3 here denotes a clear enough boundary here. If the proof itself is incomprehensible, poorly structured, or has other significant problems unrelated to the subject matter, then this person is better served by improving their basic proving skills before looking into proofs of this complicated matter. These are off-topic, and should be closed.</p>
<p>Note that also, even if the question literally asks to check their proof, it should be interpreted as 'find the mistake'. This is different from grading an assignment, even if we are guaranteed to have a mistake somewhere. Why? An assignment is a measure of the writers competence in their field. An error in an assignment is basically everything that shows incompetence (In practice, grading schemes are of course more lenient and require the student to only show competence on a few well-defined points). We are not here to judge/grade someone's competence. But I see no reason to disallow questions about erroneous arguments for that reason.</p>
<hr />
<p>To clarify my viewpoint, let me give a few examples.</p>
<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/86275/"">Naive argument that P ≠ NP</a>: this question gets a full score, passing all three points. I think this is a good question and clearly so.</p>
<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/108496/"">Contradiction proof for inequality of P and NP</a>: this one passes 2 and 3, but it is not clear to me whether it passes 1. This is one of the reasons that I prefer to judge only on points 2 and 3. I think this question is fine and well within the lines, although not as clear as the previous one. (The difference in votes is better explained by the HNQ exposure of this question, rather than the inherent quality)</p>
<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/87084"">Solving Diophantine equations: does having a bound on the size of the solution help?</a>: Note that this question has been rather radically edited to solve various issues. In its original form, this is a question that I would consider a bad one. It is long, and littered with irrelevant or mostly unhelpful digressions. On the surface, it fails all points, and in its original form, it should have been closed. Still, it is based on an interesting assumption, which is not clearly false, but unproven (and likely even harder than resolving P vs. NP). This is not obvious at first, however. Unless someone is able to 'extract' a good question out of these, these questions should be closed. While it is nice if someone does this, we have no obligation to the author to do so.</p>
<hr />
<p>In summary, I think that asking about such proofs should be acceptable, if</p>
<ol>
<li>The proof is short and has only a few points; and</li>
<li>The proof is cleanly phrased, well-formed and based on standard terminology.</li>
<li>The question has no other problems that would apply to any type of question. See e.g. <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1286/"">here</a> or <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask"">the help center</a> for more on what to do and what to avoid when asking a question.</li>

5,"<p>thx for asking about one of my favorite CS topics of all time, but alas also at times a controversial ""lightning rod"". there is huge interest in the P vs NP problem by both amateurs and professionals but alas its been described as a ""crank magnet"" topic, but then theres also some concern on SE about avoiding that characterization as <a href=""https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2844/stop-using-the-word-crank-on-cstheory-se"">not tactful</a>. somewhat involved in that theres a $1M prize by <a href=""https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Claymath institute</a> that has gone unclaimed for nearly 2 decades now.</p>

<p>as for site policy, my feeling, and others have expressed similar sentiments, is this site could function positively as an <em>occasional</em> peer review system for papers on the subject. there is a history of 2 attempts that went viral in cyberspace over 2 decades: Deolalikar and Blum, and some experts have had favorable response to those <em>review ""efforts""</em>. the emphasis would be on trying to educate people in answers in a professional/ <em>public relations/ pop science</em> way why particular attempts typically fail and try to focus more on ""higher quality"" attempts. think there is value in this as a public service instead of shunning all such effort.</p>

<p>suggest that we use upvotes or downvotes to express enthusiasm or unenthusiasm respectively for the specific proof attempt in the question but not <em>immediately</em> close questions on the subject unless the attacks/ attempts are of very low quality. its also helpful to refer to the papers as <em>attacks or attempts</em> or <em>claimed proofs</em> instead of <em>proofs</em>. suggest that questions refer to published papers and not try to be self-contained proofs. and everyone can start to understand that advancement of science is a <em>collaborative process</em> that involves <em>peer review</em> and in the 21st century sometimes cyberspace systems/ social media can play a positive role in that effort.</p>

5,"<p>Recently, I have asked a question and it doesn't seem to get an answer and is remaining on hold.  I have edited the question and removed any content that I believed was unnessary. I believe the reason being that it is taken as one of those ""P vs NP"" proof questions. This is not my primary intentions. My intentions are to ask if the algorithm generates Sudoku grids of any arbitrary size following a circular shift language.  </p>

<p>To be honest, I did indirectly imply a potential proof existed. I didn't state it because I wanted to avoid downvote and get put on hold. Not just for that reason, but for the reason that I'm still learning complexity and algorithms. I don't have many credentials, knowledges, or experiences to say so. If I was highly confident, I would have a proof, I would write a reduction of circuit-sat into my algorithm and publish it. Otherwise, I would continue learning more and more.</p>

<p>I am vaguely aware of the P vs NP policy, because many cry wolf and unfortunately genuine attempts at anything can be closed.   An answer in the prior question says proofs should be short and have few points and that its cleanly phrased.</p>

<p><em>Overall, in what ways can I avoid the implication of ""cry proof"" while growth is expanding into my project?</em>  <em>And, how do I get my question off of hold?</em></p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>Since I have put your post on hold, I will first explain why I did so. I have not done this because of the topic of the question. The reason why I put it on hold is because </p>

<ol>
<li>At the time I did, your question was unclear to <em>me</em>. </li>
<li>The long comment chain, people asking for clarifications there and suggesting you to read up on standard terminology, led me to believe your question was not clear to <em>others</em> either. </li>
<li>The post is not self-contained. While you should link to your other post, I would at least expect a summary of the algorithm in question, as that is central to <em>this</em> post. Currently, I really don't know what your question is even about without referring to other material.</li>
</ol>

<p>If these points are improved, then I think your post can be reopened. It may help to try and refine a few things in <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/92911/discussion-on-question-by-travis-wells-generating-circulant-matrices-with-3x3-pe"">chat</a> first, but that is up to you. </p>

<p>Often, I inform people how they should improve their post to get it reopened. It did not do so here, because other users were already working with you on improving/clarifying the question.</p>

<hr>

<p>For completeness, let me explain how you would reopen a question <em>in general</em>. A question can get closed after having received 5 close votes from users with at least 4K rep, or singlehandedly by a moderator. (there is also some abilities for gold tag-badge users, but those are rare here)</p>

<p>A question can get reopened by 5 reopen votes from users with at least 4K rep, or again singlehandedly by a moderator. Whenever a closed question is edited or a reopen vote is cast on it, it gets send to the reopen queue, where users can decide to cast a reopen vote as well.</p>

<p>So, in principle, questions can get closed and reopened without moderator involvement at all. However, on Computer Science, there are simply too few active >4K rep users to do this effectively, meaning that the moderators are more actively involved in this process. This means that a user can be more pro-active and should ask the one who closed the question for clarification. I think this can be mostly done in the comments, though, but a meta question also works.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<h2>Closure reasons</h2>

<p>Your posts are closed because are unclear, not self-contained, using non-standard definitions and mixing terminology. P = NP attempt in the background is not a problem in your posts, because you did not throw your attempt with peer review request, but it is easy to connect pieces together. You were given advises, learning path plans and background required to such attempt and rules that governs this site. Please reiterate through them once more.</p>

<h2>Consecutive posts</h2>

<p>At very <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/107183/will-this-algorithm-always-solve-a-constrained-sudoku-puzzle-in-quadratic-time"">first</a> post you have indeed started to attempt P vs NP problem, with tags and comments indicating this and to be honest I do not think it is cranky or wrong, it is just a wrong place and I all the time insist that you need some proper tools (definitions, understanding) to start a journey or realize the attempt is not going into good direction. It took whole day for me and ryan to extract underneath question and drop heavy implications from it. Overall it was 29 times edited, so I have asked you to wait and do less editing. You did, so thank you for that.</p>

<p>Here was missing post, but it literally asked the first question once more with question whether it would work, in the comments we have come to conclusion that it is a very long journey from your solver to proving P = NP, and exchanged advises to read about definitions (P, NP, NP-Compete, Sudoku, solver etc.).</p>

<p>Then you asked <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/107344/sudoku-puzzles-in-o-log-n-time-although-inefficient"">second</a> question and got definition of Sudoku generalization (<span class=""math-container"">$k^2 \times k^2$</span>) and info about what is NP-Hard.<br>
Take a moment to look at this post, it has one edit, it is self-contained, you have not been asked what is going on, posts should look like this.</p>

<p>Your <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/108451/3-dnf-proves-the-algorithm-is-in-p-class"">third</a> post has wrong construction, it links previous question and once more shows your permuting/shifting operator which takes half of your post.<br>
Answer suggests reading the definitions. It was clear at this point that you haven't read them.</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/108538/generating-circulant-matrices-with-3x3-permuted-submatrices-of-any-length-to-gen"">Another</a> post got closed, it took 11 edits and you still ask if something that works will work. By the way, 12 x 12 is not <span class=""math-container"">$k^2 \times k^2$</span> grid, is it?<br>
In the comments you have given me definition of NP, and it was wrong.<br>
Please read my comment and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/9556/what-is-the-definition-of-p-np-np-complete-and-np-hard"">definitions</a>, this time for real.<br>
The construction of your post is wrong, you have referenced previous question, shown some 12 x 12 grid, formatted it twice, which I have asked you several times to drop and then asked whether your idea generalizes. After edit there is hand-waving argument about checking your equation at Wolfram and it works. I cannot follow your attempt, but if you are convinced that it works (and it was shown at least twice to you earlier), the post is not needed. If it is, you cannot show formatted consecutive natural numbers, format them into matrix and ask whether it generates Sudoku grid, parts of posts clearly do not stick together.</p>

<p>Your <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/108549/3sat-formula-with-only-positive-variables"">last</a> post still suggests that you are confused with 3SAT and grid generator.</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>You have used over 5 posts to show your grid generator, but people still cannot get your idea, please stick to one definition (created by ryan), drop all irrelevant steps, and read carefully <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/9556/what-is-the-definition-of-p-np-np-complete-and-np-hard"">What is the definition of $P$, $NP$, $NP$-complete and $NP$-hard?</a> then <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/23593/is-there-a-system-behind-the-magic-of-algorithm-analysis"">Is there a system behind the magic of algorithm analysis?</a> and then read all <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&amp;q=sudoku"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&amp;q=sudoku</a><br>
This links aim at helping you to sort out definitions, get grasp of what is important to you.</p>

<h2>Notice</h2>

<p>You need to create real Sudoku solver, not mapper to continue your attempts, an algorithm that solves any valid Sudoku 9 x 9 grid. Measure its complexity, then generalize to <span class=""math-container"">$k^2 \times k^2$</span> and then, with your knowledge after reading given posts you may continue.</p>

<h2>What will be closed in the future</h2>

<p>You cannot throw another grid cyclic creator, insist it is solver, use half space of the post to show it generates some numbers and connect it to DNF, 3SAT or any other thing asking us to connect dots for you in the way you did.  </p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>Please, once again, start using standard terminology.  </p>

<p>Sudoku puzzle is uniquely (or pairwise not uniquely) solvable grid with hints/clues (more than 9 for 9 x 9 grid). (look at <a href=""https://www.websudoku.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.websudoku.com/</a> what you see is Sudoku instance), whole grid filled with numbers abiding Sudoku rules is solved instance. If you want to describe solver, it will get encoded instance and return solved grid.</p>

<p>Grids generated by your shifting are subset of all possible puzzles, so you literally cannot infer anything from this.  </p>

<p>It doesn't make sense to try instances 50 x 50 or 100 x 100, since you get result that it will always work. It works, yet still nothing follows from this.  </p>

<p>One box (3 x 3) is not solved, it is filled. It is not enough to provide solution.</p>

5,"<p>This is somewhat improvement, but please, take a step back with your attempts. Pick a book, read questions here, take some course and learn basics. It cannot be done in one or two days, human brain needs three days to acquire concept and a week to remember it, with exercise execution when you keep revising every day. Otherwise, it will be shallow concept lost from memory in less than month.</p>

<p>There is a quote from Wikipedia, a summary of your attempt, your algorithm and still you try to merge complex concepts with your idea, and it does not stick.</p>

<p>I fully understand why, it is easier to grasp concepts through something close and familiar, but here unfortunately you really need to let it go and learn differently.</p>

<p>You have given a summary here in the comments, but all the time your questions are in the terms of your generator.</p>

<p>Imagine that I like Kakuro and you do not know this game, I
am using some odd bit counting method to solve it, we talk, I ask you all the time to express anything in the terms of Kakuro. After a while you realize, that my operation is addition, but works only for even numbers, so you try to ask about odd numbers. Well, it simply fails because my Kakuro is even. So you try to somewhat tune in and it suffices for some time, but then you realize, we simply cannot continue this way, when I ask you to express Chess in terms of Kakuro addition, then ask about Draughts, then Hex and then ask more and more unrelated questions, like car driving, wood cutting or more on-topic, whether my Kakuro addition is NEXP-Hard and built this on assumption that some people add numbers really slowly.</p>

<p>Here huge problem arises, your generator (or mine addition example) is not complex enough to allow describing concepts in terms of it. Unfortunately it does not even allow talking about Sudoku, because it is not fully operational yet.</p>

<p>We are not tutoring site, to go through step by step with your journey into complexity theory, so iterative posts doesn't work well. Commonly it takes at least one semester of studies learning complexity theory, but you realize soon enough that it was not full knowledge, but description of tools to start. Try to understand us, we simply cannot believe that you have outsmarted learning curve and now keep going into advanced terms.</p>

<p>Any further help without your real involvement into learning will be harmful as you will get shallow or erroneous understanding, but keep building.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>I'm seeking clarity after many failed attempts to understand a few sentences that I read from a Wikipedia page. So I'm asking here on Computer-science for better understanding.</p>

<h2>Misconception From Wikipedia</h2>

<p>Unless P=NP any poly-time algorithm must asymptotically be wrong on more than polynomially many of the exponentially many inputs of a certain size.<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><em>Why and how is that easy instances of NP-complete problems that are solved in poly-time do or don't have any consequence on the P vs NP problem?</em></p>

<ol>
<li>A true claim doesn't make a question.</li>
<li>A question around a true claim doesn't make good SE post.</li>
<li>What's obvious to you is not always obvious to others.</li>
<li>The claim may not be true.</li>
<li>You can not do anything direct about downvotes.</li>
<li>You can incorporate the feedback given to you into your post and hope some downvoters change their mind.</li>
<li>Downvotes should probably not matter to you beyond indicating something is wrong with your post.</li>

5,"<p>There are some problems beyond what Raphael said:<br>
This is not a blog, if you do more than 20 edits it is a problem on its own.<br>
When you find that something was not obvious or omitted in the question, please, do not make partial answer in the question via numerous edits.</p>

<p>Proof by contradiction is not frowned upon, it is a general problem that when you have all the tools and all the knowledge and pick one proving technique, it is simply request ""do that work for me, the way I have imagined"", so it is no longer a question, point blank request in sugar coating.</p>

<p>Showing one or two examples does not constitute definition. The amount of work and time spent on your project is irrelevant, we can only work with textual description that you give us, we have no clue what you have learned and where are your difficulties and obstacles in the project. You want answers, we do not want (or like) to guess what is the question really about, incremental improvements do not work for us, at least not the way that more than 100 revisions among several questions are placed. Since this didn't help, it is a high time to change something.</p>

<p>This site should serve as the knowledge vault, Q&amp;A, but there are things that are off-topic here:<br>
Science advancements, one-on-one tutoring, too localized questions that are important only to you.</p>

<p>If people are not interested in your post, well, it happens, but it does not pose meta discussion thread yet.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I am stepping down as a moderator, and you deserve to know why. I cannot condone actions that the company has recently taken (behind close doors, although I expect more will become public soon).</p>

<p>Social life means being confronted to different points of view. This is especially true on in an international setting such as Stack Exchange where you get to encounter people from different cultures. When interacting with others, you need to draw lines — for example, racism is not acceptable, full stop — and within those bounds, you need to open up to diversity. Sometimes that means listening to multiple points of view, and sometimes agree to disagree, and sometimes compromise.</p>

<p>I have witnessed a disagreement between moderators where both sides made some good points. Both sides deserved and requested respect. One side was aware that their behavior could hurt even though no malice was intended and tried to go out of their way in order not to be hurtful. The other side demanded to have things their way, and did not care who they were hurting on the process. In this particular dispute, there was clearly a victim and aggressors. <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193/stack-overflow-inc-sinat-chinam-and-the-goat-for-azazel"">The victim has now written up her side of the story</a>.</p>

<p>Stack Exchange intervened, did not try to calm spirits, came firmly on the uncompromising side, and fired the victim in a very hurtful manner. This is not an environment I feel safe in, and certainly not an environment I can or will help foster.</p>

<p>I have been a participant on Stack Exchange for 9 years and a volunteer moderator across different sites for more than 8. Stepping down is a big thing for me. I am very disappointed to go that way. But I simply cannot continue.</p>

<p>I still value building a shared library of knowledge. I see a question and answer site as a useful complement to an encyclopedia, whose role Wikipedia fulfills. However, the way it is run now makes me doubt that Stack Exchange is a good place to build this library, so I will be reevaluating my participation.</p>

I find the actions of SE against <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/users/472/monica-cellio"">Monica</a> intentional, perhaps personal, and highly inappropriate.

",CSmeta
5,"<p>Apologies for the slight hijacking of the thread.</p>

<p>I endorse your decision to resign. I am no longer going to contribute to any Stack Exchange site. Moderators and major contributors (of which I do <em>not</em> include myself) have been underappreciated by Stack Exchange for a long time, but in the past couple of years it has transitioned to outright mistreatment. I think I'm a significant enough contributor where my disengagement is only almost entirely meaningless instead of completely meaningless.</p>

<p>My decision is largely due to past events summarized <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/331513/lets-take-a-look-at-the-interaction-between-staff-and-the-power-users-of-the"">here</a>. I considered leaving then but decided to give Stack Exchange a chance to improve things, though I didn't have much hope. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/firing-mods-and-changing-content-license-is-stack-exchange-still-interested-in#333965"">Current events including this one</a> make clear that things aren't going to improve and that the relationship between company and community is <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/387546/we-re-removing-hot-meta-posts-from-stack-overflows-sidebar-for-now-moderator/387633#387633"">irreparable</a>.</p>

<p>I had two concerns. For the first, as the summaries state, much of the issue isn't with the decisions made themselves &ndash; some I agree with and many I do not &ndash; but the manner in which Stack Exchange went about making and communicating them and what they implied. In particular, the amount of respect from Stack Exchange seems inversely proportional to the amount you've contributed. Tweet as someone who has <em>never used the site</em> and Stack Exchange will make changes within 24 hours. Ask for those same changes as a major contributor and moderator and be ignored for years. To be clear, I have never been a moderator. My contributions have been moderate, and so I'm intermediate in the amount of (dis)respect. However, even as a bystander, it's hard to watch Stack Exchange spit in the face of people who've volunteered large amounts of their time, expertise, and emotional well-being. This definitely doesn't encourage me to contribute more to Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>My second concern is well illustrated by the current situation. In a surprisingly quick escalation to its logical conclusion (and beyond), apparently asking questions about the Code of Conduct is itself a punishable violation of the Code of Conduct (even before it's in force). Again, I'm not a moderator and don't have access to the forums where the current situation unfolded. Perhaps Monica's behavior was completely unacceptable. I find this extremely hard to believe given people's reactions and the many past interactions I've seen of Monica's which always came off as respectful and genuine even when I disagreed with the content. And then there's the usual double standard where <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193/stack-overflow-inc-sinat-chinam-and-the-goat-for-azazel#comment16248_5197"">vague insinuations of bad behavior or motives</a> by those behind the policies are not viewed as harmful to an environment of ""inclusion and respect"" where they (rightfully) would be if done by anyone else.</p>

<p>I don't really want to support Stack Exchange by continuing to contribute to it nor do I want to tacitly endorse Stack Exchange's current behavior.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I would suggest you start by editing your question based on the comments you have already received.  You already made a number of changes to improve your question based on feedback received, so I can understand why you might be discouraged or tired, but I want to give you some encouragement -- there is only a finite number of things you will need to address, and I believe you can do it.</p>

<p>I left you comments on how to improve your question.  Here is what I previously wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now the problem is clear, but you copied from another source word-for-word without indicating what was copied.  We ask that you indicate which material is quoted or copied from another source by using the <code>&gt;</code> blockquote environment -- see <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/referencing"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/referencing</a> and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/formatting"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/formatting</a> for guidance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say ""I have given the credits"", but as I explain in the comment above, you have not followed our guidelines for how to give credit.</p>

<p>I also wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, what is your question, specifically?  If you didn't understand what they wrote and you're asking us to explain it to you, I worry that if someone else tries to explain it you might not understand that either.  It would help to ask a specific question about some specific aspect of it, and tell us what you did and didn't understand about that solution to help us give you an answer that will be useful to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a question-and-answer site, so we require you to articulate a single, specific question in your post about your problem (it's not enough to just show the statement of the problem).</p>

<p>Neither of these comments have been addressed yet.</p>

<p>I don't know whether it's likely whether you will get an answer; I imagine that might depend on how you address the feedback you have received.  Don't assume that if you make these changes you are unlikely to receive an answer; I think it is entirely possible that if you improve the question, it will attract a good answer from someone who knows the subject.</p>

<p>Also, don't assume that ""on hold"" is permanent.  ""On hold"" is intended as a temporary status, to give you a chance to improve the question.  We want to make sure that the question is clear before inviting people to answer the question, and we want to save people from taking the time to write an answer that might be later invalidated if the question they answered wasn't the one you wanted them to answer.  Once the question is clear, the ""on hold"" status can be removed.</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I can suggest two ways to handle the case where you misinterpreted the question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Delete your answer.  Enough said, no further action needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete your answer.  Post a new question, that asks the question you thought you were answering, and post your answer there.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How to choose between those two?  It might depend, for instance, on whether you expect the alternate question to be useful to others in the future.</p>

<p>You might also consider whether it makes sense to edit the question to make it clearer, to help other readers avoid misinterpreting it in the same way you did.  You might not be the only one to come away with the wrong impression of what is being asked.</p>

5,"<p>Recently I find that <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/391832/5376789"">the close/reopen vote threshold is reduced from 5 to 3 in StackOverflow</a>.

",CSmeta
5,"<p>No.  Not unless we specifically ask for it.</p>

<p>If you would like to see the close/open threshold reduced to 3, it is my understanding that Stack Exchange is willing to try it out here if there is a strong agreement here in favor of that.  But, we have to go through the process.</p>

<p>So, if you'd like to see that happen, start a new question, ask whether the threshold should be changed, post an answer saying ""yes"" and why, and let people vote on it.  If there's strong support for it, I'll get in touch with the Stack Exchange folks to ask them to make that change for us.  I <em>will</em> need to be able to demonstrate to them that we went through the discussion process in the community and that there was strong support for this change, which is why posting such a question (separately) is the way to kick off that process.</p>

I motivate this with high threshold for votes, rather small community (compared to SO for example), which in turn yields poor users' moderation.</p>

If you feel like some additional comment is needed, please write it below answer it belongs to.</p>

<p>For simplicity, I propose that we use only upvotes on given answer to avoid counting twice (say downvote to “no” and upvote to “yes” may be inconsistent, some users may cast one, some two votes).</p>

<p>As an example case, someone posted a question at SO on how an AES inversion matrix and its inverse are generated.

Would the reverse engineering and/or derivation of those matrices qualify as an ""algorithm"", and belong in computer science or in math?</p>

<p>As far as questions about finite fields, well, it depends what your question is.  For example, questions about algorithms for working with finite fields are on-topic here.  Questions about implementations or coding are off-topic here and should go to Stack Overflow.

<p>¹ ""Community"" here refers both to <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/users"">the membership of Computer Science</a> <em>without</em> <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators"">diamonds next to their names</a>, and to the automated systems otherwise known as <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/-1"">user #-1</a>.</p>

<p>² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.</p>

<p>³ A ""destroyed"" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>

<p>⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>

<p>⁵ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes).</p>

<p>⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>

<p>⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   </p>

<p>Not all questions have a home somewhere on Stack Exchange.  Some are simply not suitable for the Stack Exchange format, or don't fall within the scope of any existing Stack Exchange site.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>What are all the possible types of output from a computer?</h1>
  
  <p>I am trying to understand what are the general types of output of a
  computer.<br> I assume the following described general types of output
  are the only ones in the cosmos, but I might be wrong:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Screened Raw Data:</strong> Output such as a document available only to be read but not edited (as when opened with a reading-only ""viewer""
  program)</li>
  <li><strong>Screened Interface:</strong> Output such as a document available to be both read and edited (as when opened with a text editor)</li>
  <li><strong>Spatial Change:</strong> Output such as the result of a computerized machine, or alternatively, a computer embedded system (such as a robot
  and maybe also quantum computer or some physical yet non material
  computer of some sort)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><sub>A similar try is defining what are the only possible ways to
  input data into computer, such as with CLUI, TUI, GUI and possibly
  other methods.</sub></p>
  
  <p><strong>What are all the possible types of output from a computer?</strong></p>
  
  <p>That is to ask: Is there a consensus among computer scientists and/or UX researchers
  about what are the general types of output of a computer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recall that the question was closed and to save it from being automatically deleted I published it in UX SE and got an answer which I accepted:</p>

I think the comment was perfectly neutral; I have not done anything wrong. Can my comment be restored?</p>

<p>To make it clear, the comment said that someone else's comment on what would be more appropriate on some other SE site was irrelevant here. It is even highly inappropriate for a user of this site to say what is and what isn't appropriate on another site. If we were to discuss it here, what would be more appropriate on some other SE site is a misleading comment in fact.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I removed that comment.  Why?  The short version is that I did not believe it contributed usefully.</p>

<p>First, let me share some background on the Stack Exchange philosophy on comments (apologies if I am describing things you are already aware of).  Comments are transient and can be deleted at any time without warning.  Comments are generally intended for, e.g., requests for clarification, suggestions to improve the post, or a post-it note for useful information that may be relevant.  They are not intended for general discussion.  See <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/19756/160917"">How do comments work?</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/237978/160917"">A guide to moderating comments</a> and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment</a> and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/flagging"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/flagging</a> for more authoritative resources on the Stack Exchange guidelines regarding comments.</p>

<p>On to the specific comment I deleted.  Your comment had two parts.  The first part, to my eye, appeared to be <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/120532/would-putting-an-unsubmitted-formal-methods-paper-to-arxiv-preclude-further-form#comment254169_120532"">basically redundant</a>, to the extent that I could understand it.  I did not see the purpose in retaining that part.  The second part disclosed that you would be flagging another comment for deletion.  I'm a bit wary about the potential for an extended debate about whether some other comment should be deleted, in the comment thread under that question.  So, I tried to head that off preemptively.  I don't see any benefit in retaining the statement that you have flagged the comment, and there is a potential harm in keeping that part of the comment (there is a potential for it to lead to an unconstructive debate on that comment thread about whether that other comment should be deleted).   If you see a comment that should be deleted, flag it, but don't leave a comment saying that you have flagged it.</p>

<p>For those reasons, I deleted it.  I'm always open to hearing a contrary perspective from the community, but absent that, I don't plan to restore it.  I can't speak for anyone else on the moderation team.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>It's kind of a philosophical formulation of the question maybe.</p>

<p>I'd answer it as:</p>

<p>Like in every encoder-decoder system, the output of the computer is processed data encoded and sent as a signal to the decoding reciever. A signal can be classified into 5 categories, one for each of the 5 senses which we use as perception tools. A multiclass perceptron can be used to model the classification process of the brain. </p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>The single comment of yours that D.W. delete was specifically addressed to him. Presumably, he read it, which made it obsolete.
Keep in mind that comments are ephemeral on SE <em>by design</em>. They <em>should not</em> stay around.</p>

<p>Regarding the comment itself, it was a moderation request that should have been a flag. Such requests are seen, considered, acted upon (""do nothing"" is a common action), and then removed.</p>

<p>In summary, I don't see any misconduct here.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>I have asked <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/120797/why-did-a-tradition-to-add-a-must-use-default-array-to-functions-was-created-and"">this question</a> on Retrocomputing SE; it got answers there, but was later closed and commenters suggested it would be a better fit for Computer Science SE.</p>

<p>Because my Retrocomputing question already got answers, I couldn't delete it before reposting a similar, better question, on Computer Science SE.</p>

<p>So, I went to Computer Science and posted a similar question there which is per my humble opinion <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/120796/why-in-general-must-function-declarations-be-followed-by-a-parameter-set"">shorter, more focused, and better phrased</a>.</p>

<p>But, after doing so, my old question from Retrocomputing SE was reopened and migrated to Computer Science SE; hence:</p>

<p><a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/115711/johndoea?tab=questions"">Now, in CS SE, there is a ""salad"" of two similar questions</a> which per my humble opinion, needs to be merged somehow --- comments and answers from the old should be migrated to the new, I think.</p>

<h2>My question</h2>

<p>I already contacted the mods of Computer Science explaining the problem and asking to merge the questions, but AFAIR, the flag was declined.</p>

<p>Will you, a mod, move all comments and answers from the old question into the <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/120796/why-in-general-must-function-declarations-be-followed-by-a-parameter-set"">new one</a>?</p>

5,"<p>2020 has come! But… oops, where did the time go? It’s already March! Belated as it is, it’s time for a refresh of <strong>Community Promotion Ads</strong>!</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>relevant blogs and websites about computer science</li>
<li>computer science events, conferences, or meetups</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1694"">here</a>.</p>

<p>If ""yes"":</p>

<p>Practical:</p>

<p>Given the safety of AI cannot be rigorously guaranteed (that is, for all reasonable definitions of ""safe"", you cannot prove AI is ""safe""), why isn't there mass concern regarding AI safety?</p>

",CSmeta
5,"<p>I believe the main component of the first question is to figure out of what exactly ""any reasonable definition"" of a safe AI is.

<p>Can I at least be able to write a question and not be able to post it until the ban is lifted?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Sometimes, questions are posted that turn out to be part of a problem from an ongoing contest. We've discussed this on meta in the past (<a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/550/questions-about-challenges-on-interview-street-and-similar-sites"">here</a>, <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1282/computer-contest-problems"">here</a>, and <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1302/is-asking-hints-for-project-euler-questions-discouraged"">here</a>), but we never settled on an explicit policy. In absence of such a policy, the moderation team has internally decided how to deal with these questions consistently. This has worked well so far, but I think it is better to have an explicit written policy. Such a policy would make it clear what people who report these questions can expect from us and allows for community input even if there is no consensus.</p>

<p>I have drafted the policy that the moderation team is more or less following right now in an answer below. Please discuss changes to a proposed policy in the comments, or suggest alternative policies or other thoughts in another answer. Note that since this answer describes the status quo, the moderation team will follow that policy unless the community clearly prefers a different policy.</p>

<p>For a bit more background, I looked around what some other sites on Stackexchange do. On Stackoverflow, <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/315955/"">contest questions are allowed if they are otherwise good questions</a>, while on Mathematics.SE <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/16774/contest-problem-policy"">contest questions are locked until the contest ends</a>. What we currently do here is somewhere in the middle of Stackoverflow and Mathematics.SE. On Physics.SE, <a href=""https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4940/question-is-part-of-a-contest"">contest questions are seen as a special case of ""academic dishonesty""</a> and are <a href=""https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2832/how-should-we-deal-with-academic-dishonesty"">locked/closed if the contest rules do not allow outside help</a>.</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>This post describes the policy that the moderation team currently applies.</p>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>If a question is clearly and specifically about an active<sup>1</sup> contest problem and would otherwise be a fine question<sup>2</sup>, then please: </p>

<ul>
<li>Leave a comment on the question with a link to the relevant contest problem.</li>
<li>Flag the question for moderator attention. </li>
</ul>

<p>If a moderator agrees that this question is about the linked contest problem, they will close the question, ask the question author to provide the source of their question, and inform the authors of any current answers of the contest problem, giving them the opportunity to delete their answers if they wish. </p>

<p>If the author of the question edits their question to clearly state that it is about an active contest problem, they can contact the moderators to have their question reopened.</p>

<p>When the contest has ended, anyone can ask to have the question reopened and answers undeleted, but the moderation team will not keep track of this.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>I do not want to blindly enforce rules imposed by other sites<sup>3</sup>. For example, suppose there is a contest with a well known problem, about which there is a question on CS.SE and someone asks to remove this question. I think it would be unreasonable to prevent discussion of a well known problem just because it is part of a contest. I could come up with more examples, but I hope you get the idea that the goals of CS.SE do not necessarily align with an arbitrary programming contest site, so we cannot just follow their rules without question.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in most of the cases where it gets reported, these contest questions will be effectively ""cheating"". I do not want to encourage such behaviour or unwittingly assist in it. However, it is not always clear if a question would be cheating. So, while I want to make sure that everyone is fully informed of the situation, I want to leave the decision of whether to answer (or retract an existing answer) to the potential answerer themselves, instead of making that decision for them.</p>

<hr>

<p><sub>1: ""active"" means the contest has an end date which lies in the future. Note that this excludes contests without an end date, since I do not want to have an indefinite embargo on questions.</sub></p>

<p><sub>2: Questions that do not meet our site standards should be closed independent of whether they are about a contest. We have some advice <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1284/how-do-i-ask-a-good-homework-question"">here</a> how to ask a good question about homework or contest problems.

<p><sub>3: This does not mean that we ignore whatever happens outside of CS.SE. For example, <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/referencing"">we do not allow plagiarism</a>, no matter the source.

<p>A new user posts a question, obtains an answer, then promptly deletes the question, before the answer gets upvoted (which would have prevented deletion of the question). Presumably, the question is a homework exercise, and the user deletes the question to hide their tracks. This is not only annoying, but also insincere, a form of cheating.</p>

<p>A simple way to solve this problem would be to prevent users with low reputation from deleting an answered question, even if the answer has no upvotes.

I don't know of any technical solution to this problem given how the Stack Exchange site currently works.</p>

<p>Everyone can form their own decisions about whether they want to answer questions that look like they might fall into this pattern.</p>

<p>Execuse me if you have some extra time, u may use it to correct a scientific fact,answer a question,..or even have some fun; do not waste it in trying to impose ur opinion or writing style on other people. This is a discussion group, not a paper or a thesis that has to follow a certain format </p>

<p>By the way, it is also a well-known principle that u should prevent read ups &amp; write downs to protect from Trojans. I suggest you should not give a higher privilege user the right to edit someone else's question or answer.</p>

5,"<p>This site works differently from others you might be used to.  A large part of our mission is to build up an archive of high-quality questions &amp; answers, that will be useful not only to the poster but also to others in the future.  To support that goal, we encourage collaborative editing to improve questions and answers, so that they'll be more likely to be helpful to others in the future.  See <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/120576/160917"">Why can any user edit any other user&#39;s question or answer?</a> and <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/editing"">https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/editing</a> for more discussion.  I realize that this might be unfamiliar for those new to the site and might take some getting used to.</p>

<p>I will share some other comments, from looking through recent edits to your answers:  We expect people to write in grammatical English.  ""Text-speak"" like using ""u"" or ""ur"" or ""r"" (instead of ""you"" or ""your"" or ""are"") is discouraged here.  Please use complete sentences.  See <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/105497/160917"">How to deal with user using txt spk</a>.   Also, please don't use Latex for emphasis; <em>this</em> looks better than <span class=""math-container"">$this$</span> (i.e., use <code>*this*</code> not <code>$this$</code>).  Latex should be reserved for mathematics.  When you do post mathematics, I encourage you to use LaTeX here to typeset mathematics in a more readable way. See <a href=""https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271/add-short-reference-for-latex-commands"">here</a> for a short introduction.  We're looking for high-quality answers that will be useful to others.</p>

5,"<p>I find the text color on cs.SE hard to read on white background, is there a way to change either the foreground or background color to something else, without resorting to user css scripts? I don't see such options anywhere but maybe they still exist?</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Unfortunately, Stack Overflow is the only site on SE that has an alternate color scheme (&quot;dark mode&quot;) as a built-in option. There is <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111399/dark-mode-for-stack-exchange-sites"">a request</a> to implement this for the entire network, but it is unknown whether or when this might be implemented.</p>
<p>So, for now, there is no other option than resorting to userscripts. <a href=""https://stackapps.com/questions/8053/stack-exchange-dark-mode"">This one</a>, for example, should work on all SE sites.</p>

5,"<p>I agree that users should be strictly upheld to creating quality questions and answers, but the issue is when someone learned from their mistakes and creates a good question. To only be reinstated into a ban because he/she received 0 votes.</p>
<p>So why not create a feature that gives a limited grace period to see if he/she can ask good questions? If said person generates enough quality content their ban is removed!</p>
",CSmeta
5,"<p>Before I get to your question of whether the question ban system is fair and should be changed, let me first explain a bit of how getting out of a question ban works in the current system. The full information is in this <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/question-bans"">help center article</a>; (Note that moderators do not have more information or are able to lift question bans) I will highlight the points I think are important here.</p>
<p>First and foremost: if you are question banned and want this ban lifted, you should <strong>improve/edit your existing questions</strong>. Any other action will be a mark against you for the system, this includes deleting questions shortly after posting them (whether poorly received or not!).</p>
<p>Additionally, if you believe you are at risk of receiving a question ban (or have received a warning that you may receive a question ban), you should try to avoid deleting questions and be <em>very careful</em> with asking new questions. Whenever you want to ask another question or delete a question, take a moment and check whether you can improve one of your existing questions, instead.</p>
<p>It may happen that you ask a question that is bad and cannot be salvaged by editing. In that case, there is little you can do. (note that if the question is 'too easy' and you got the answer on your own, one option would be  to <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/self-answer"">answer your own question</a> ) So, you should do whatever you can to avoid asking a truly bad question. Taking a good look at the question before posting and the various advice on asking good questions listed on <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/question-bans"">this page</a> can help here.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, to answer your actual question, 'a limited grace period to see if he/she can ask good questions' already exists in some form. Every 6 months after receiving a question ban, the user is allowed to ask one question, and if that question is positively received, the ban is lifted. (see also <a href=""https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/question-bans"">here</a>, at the bottom) Note that this is sort of an edge-case, and I advise against actually waiting this period out, and suggest to instead focus on <strong>improving/editing your existing questions</strong>.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the user is 'off the hook': all negative points that lead to the user getting a question ban in the first place are still being taken into account, and if the user again posts poorly received questions, the system can again impose a question ban. Likely, this ban would be given earlier than with a user that has never had a question ban before.</p>
<p>I can see that this may seem unfair. Unfortunately, I don't think it is reasonable to let a user start with a clean slate after getting out of a question ban: in that case, it is possible to abuse the system by only posting one decent question and a lot of bad questions after that, and repeat this every 6 months. I think it is essential that the previously banned user needs to prove that they can ask good questions, by forcing them to do so consistently if they want to avoid a question ban.</p>
<p>You may also think the single question is too short a grace period or the 6 months is too long to be granted this opportunity. However, this opportunity is a leniency on behalf of the system, and should <em>not</em> be the main way to get out of a question ban, which is to <strong>improve/edit your existing questions</strong>. Now, this may not always be possible -- which is one reason this opportunity exists --, but these are the exceptions, and is therefore discouraged.</p>
<p>In case you're interested, there is some old discussion about how strict or permanent the question ban should be <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/116450/"">here</a>, and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/172300/what-happens-to-folks-who-get-question-banned-by-and-large"">another old discussion</a> about whether users recover from a question ban in practice, and how.</p>
