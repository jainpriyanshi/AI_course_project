<p>Debugging shaders can be quite different from ""normal"" debugging, and involves very unique challenges. Furthermore, someone not working with computer graphics will never encounter these issues.

I'll quote part of <a href=""https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/a/17427/111139"">an answer I made there</a> as it seems relevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is fundamentally a <em>programming</em> site, as opposed to a site about art or design. We want questions that you'd encounter in the course of coding a renderer, basically. (Either a 2D or 3D renderer. Either real-time or offline. Either running on a GPU or not. Creating either photorealistic images or non-photorealistic ones, etc.)</p>
<p>What <em>wouldn't</em> be on-topic, for instance, would be questions about how to use 3D modeling tools, or how to create a skybox in Photoshop, or how to select a color palette for lighting a scene. Added to that, I guess we probably would not want questions about how to use specific 3D engines, e.g. &quot;how can I increase shadow quality in Unity/UE4/whatever&quot;. (Maybe I'm wrong about that, but I don't consider such questions very interesting, and I think they belong on an engine-specific community site.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appropriateness of engine-specific or tool-specific questions was probably the issue people disagreed about the most.  I argued against such questions above, but some others argued that questions specifically about Unity, UE4, Maya, Houdini, etc. were fine.  I think we'll have to give it a try and refine our criteria as we go.  The main concern for me about such questions is that they have to do with <em>programming</em> with those tools, as opposed to just <em>using</em> the tools.  For instance, I can see questions about how to build a custom exporter plugin for Maya, or how to implement rendering technique X in UE4, as potentially on-topic.</p>
<p>Also, I want to expand a bit to say that not just rendering, but other related areas such as image processing, particles/fluids/cloth simulation, geometry processing (e.g. CSG, voxelization, remeshing), procedural geometry/texture generation and such things like that are probably on topic here as well.  Maybe parts of computer vision too.  Again, we'll probably have to refine the &quot;edges&quot; as we go.</p>

3,"<p>I think we should make the decision about YouTube embedding independently of any other features like MathJax. From a technical point of view, YouTube embedding isn't really ""expensive"" the way that MathJax is, because the conversion of a link into a player happens on the server and doesn't require SE to deliver loads of JavaScript with every single page request. I think from SE's point of view YouTube embedding (as well as SoundCloud embedding, btw) are the less problematic features.</p>

<p>If activating <em>all</em> of the extra features we're interested in is a problem, I'm sure the devs will tell us. So I don't think there's much point in not asking for it just because we're afraid of asking for too much. If we don't ask, we won't know.</p>

<p>So let's ignore any other feature requests we're interested in. Would YouTube embeddings be useful to us? I'd say <strong>yes, they'd be very useful</strong>. There <em>will</em> be questions about how to achieve certain graphical effects, and there's only so much words can do to explain what exact effect that is. Showing an actual video of it would be much more expressive. This applies to both questions and answers. So I'm fairly certain that we <em>will</em> regularly use YouTube videos to make our points... so why have people load YouTube and leave the site to watch the video, if they could just watch it right there in the browser?</p>

<p>And regarding </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It encourages questions of the kind how do i do this that do not always work out as valuable contribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think so. If someone wants to ask a bad ""how can I do X, plz give me teh codez"" question, they'll do it with or without an embedded video. However, there could also be great questions requiring videos (think ""I'm trying to achieve this diorama effect. I've attempted X, Y and Z, but I just can't the depth of field to do it's magic. What am I doing wrong?""), and making it easier for those kinds of questions seems like a great opportunity for this community.</p>

<p>What I'm saying is, we'll have to watch the quality of our questions either way. This feature is going to encourage ""video-only questions"" as much as having code blocks encourages ""code-only answers"". SE is a great platform for building high-quality content, and having YouTube embeds will in no way torpedo that mission.</p>

As such it sounds on topic. However, a comment shows that the parallel use of GPUs is not the main problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good answer is predicated on knowing how the displays will be connected to the available GPUs (getting 9+ display outputs on a single computer isn't trivial) and the software responsible for your render.

Hundreds of questions without sufficient variation to explore the scope are unlikely to get us to public beta.</p>

",ComputerGraphicmeta,se sites notably want questions best practices lead opinionated answers think definitely risk certainly also great value questions get useful answers example posted question earlier today want allow questions best practices
3,"<p>I think we should allow them but carefully watch the answer quality. It can be really hard to find out best practices in niche programming fields like computer graphics, especially because the vastly different paradigms of GPU programming mean that the established patterns from ""normal"" programming can't always be applied. This being a community of computer graphics experts, we should be in a perfect position to collect actual best practices for computer graphics. I think this potential should not be easily dismissed, just because ""answers might be opinionated"".</p>

<p>Instead, let's try to be careful with answers and make sure we encourage the same high quality for these than for any others. So what makes a good answer to a best-practice question:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don't</strong> just answer with ""here's what I do, it's the best!""</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> include <em>objective</em> pros and cons of the practices your answer covers.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> include authoritative references which show that it's actually established practice where applicable (i.e. when your answer is more about ""the accepted practice"" than ""<em>the</em> best practice"", which can also be an important consideration).</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> point out if certain choices are merely a matter of preference (and list the available options).</li>
</ul>

<p>If we take care that answers to these questions don't deteriorate from our normal standards, I don't see any harm in having these questions.</p>

<p>After all, <em>any</em> programming question probably has multiple solutions which could invite answers fighting for which solution (i.e. practice) is the best in the given situation. Asking for a practice explicitly doesn't really change that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here's a few words of advice on writing tag wiki excerpts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The excerpt is the elevator pitch for the tag. You only have ~500 plain text characters for the excerpt, so don't feel obligated to cover everything in it! Save that for the 30,000+ character Markdown tag wiki. The excerpt should define the shared quality of questions containing this tag -- boiled down to a few short sentences.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid generically defining the concept behind a tag, unless it is highly specialized. The &quot;email&quot; tag, for example, does not need to explain what email is.

3,"<p>To me the answer is clearly yes. Monte Carlo integration is, like you said, the underpinning of a huge area of computer graphics but, more vitally, this area (path-tracing and offline rendering) is the one most under-represented in StackExchange right now: Real-time rendering is mostly considered on-topic in the GameDev SE, and if you restrict general math that finds a common use in CG, you'll end up removing a lot of the point of this SE existing, which is to house more theoretically-minded questions, which naturally will involve more theory and math.</p>

My guess is that we have quite a lot of people who are new to the Stack Exchange format so we need to actively encourage people to use their open and close votes (not just up and down votes), and emphasise that voting to close is a positive thing - a question can still be reopened once it has been edited to make it on topic.</p>

<p>The classic ""mirrors and point lights only"" ray tracing is really more appropriately named ""Whitted ray tracing"".

<p>I don't know how this is commonly handled on SE, but I suggest we leave ""ray tracing"" as a catch-all tag and additionally add more specific subtags such as ""whitted ray tracing"", ""path tracing"" and friends where appropriate.</p>

  <p>""Is this enough of a reason to justify making an exception to ""show what you have tried""? ""  </p>

<p>Yes.<br>
I think probably the lack of screenshots (or other results) in the question you refer to is due to the lack of a working implementation that the asker would have achieved.  </p>

<p>Sometimes, you might have very few clues about how to solve a problem in a domain you are not familiar with. Then, there is not much to try except gathering information in the domain. cg.se is also a place for that purpose.<br>
Problem solving is a continuous process, that generates many questions. The problem that the asker is trying to solve looks still ""fresh"" to them, but nevertheless already interesting.<br>
As community members, why would we have to wait for more results before we can attempt to help and propose solutions to that problem too ?  </p>

<p>The ""show what you have tried"" rule sounds to me like a way to ensure that the asker has provided sufficient personal effort before deciding to submit a question to cg.se. In the question you referred to, the clarity and details of the explanations of the problem show that the asker has spent some time thinking and analyzing their problem.  </p>

<p>More generally, I don't think the rules to accept questions should be as rigid as to not being able to bear some exceptions.  </p>

3,"<p>Yes it does.

Answers on SE sites should be self-contained to be as future-proof as possible.

<li>MathJax plus Stack Snippets that work perfectly well apart from jQuery which needs a minor workaround.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Note that MathJax works perfectly fine either way, so the choice can be summed up as:</em></strong></p>

<li><strong><em>No Stack Snippets at all.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Stack Snippets that work perfectly well apart from jQuery which needs a minor workaround.</em></strong></li>

<p><em>(Click</em> ""Run Code Snippet"" <em>at the bottom of that answer)</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>More detail</h2>

<p>The problem is that using <code>$</code> in a code snippet multiple times can lead to errors in the way the code is displayed, because MathJax also uses <code>$</code>. <strong>Note that this applies to code snippets in general - not just Stack Snippets</strong>, so not having Stack Snippets would not eliminate the problem.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell this mostly affects snippets that use jQuery, so it is perfectly possible to use pure JavaScript or other libraries.</p>

<p>Even for code using jQuery it is possible to work around the problem by simply using <code>jQuery</code> in place of <code>$</code> (<code>$</code> is just an alias for <code>jQuery</code>), which seems a fairly painless workaround.</p>

<p>Since this means it is already possible to use both MathJax and Stack Snippets, I see no reason to wait for things to be perfect. Once we have both, we can push for a fix, which I would guess would then happen faster for all sites affected, due to having more voices calling for it. In the meantime it has zero effect on MathJax, and a manageable effect on Stack Snippets.</p>

<p>Now, the tag synonym privileges are a bit weird. For one thing, we don't have any users yet who have enough rep to suggest the synonyms, but they also require a certain score in the relevant tag, which isn't necessarily easy to obtain with the breadth of topics we're currently focussing on.</p>

<p>Would the CMs be able to do some cleaning up at this point or will we just have to wait until we've got sufficiently high-rep users?</p>

<p>For reference, here are a bunch of synonyms I discovered, with the proposed parent tag listed first:</p>

First, tag synonyms can be suggested with 1250 reputation and score of 5+ on the tag, which won't change in public beta. Second when we reach public beta we'll have a few pro-tem moderators who probably can do this, too.</p>

3,"<p>Although the question seems simple to someone who knows how it works, there are aspects that are not immediately obvious to everyone (like how can there be more than 2 frames of animation?).</p>

<p>I don't feel that the fact that it can be done on paper is a problem. You can paint a 3D scene on paper, or you can generate and print a 3D scene on paper using a computer. We don't want questions on painting by hand, but questions on generating images to later be printed on paper are fine (as long as it is about how to generate the image, not how to change the paper).</p>

<p>I can see there being valid questions on the topic of grating animations, and how to write a program that generates images suitable for a given grating. The explanation of how they work is simple, but I'd expect there to be subtleties beyond that. For example, the transition between frames may be able to be smoothed by considering the shapes of the strips of image.</p>

<p>The only thing I would change is to show what you have tried. Hopefully this will also narrow it down to ""I'm confused about this aspect"" rather than a general ""how does this work?"".</p>

<p>I've raised this in particular because I've asked a few polling questions already, as have a few others, and I fear unless we discuss it, our example will lead to polling becoming an unthinking default, rather than an occasional tool to complement discussion.</p>

3,"<p><em>I'm posting this as a place to share thoughts - clearly it is not our decision but it's good to have an understanding of what factors may affect that decision, especially as that decision has been</em> <strong><a href=""https://computergraphics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/114/231"">delayed until next week</a></strong> <em>to give us a last chance to prove that our dip in questions is temporary.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Obviously we all hope that we will be granted a public beta - that's why we signed up. A separate site feels positive and independent and gives a sense of identity. However, none of these is the <strong><em>reason</em></strong> for being a separate site, they just provide us with motivation.</p>

<p>I was very interested by the bullet points in Robert Cartaino's answer to <a href=""https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/17837/apparently-this-is-a-duplicate"">Apparently this is a duplicate</a>, so I'll reproduce a few of them here for discussion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to split off a site, we would need to see a clear demonstration that the topic will likely do much better on the new site (presumably without gutting the existing one). We would be looking for things like:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>An ecosystem of questions that are not already in scope on the existing site(s)</li>
  <li>A show of numbers that clearly demonstrates the parent site is failing to attract that audience ← this is a big one</li>
  <li>A weighty argument that a new community exists that does not identify themselves as part of the larger subject (Ubuntu versus Unix)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>My own thoughts on this have ended up longer than I'd expected, so I'll post them as an answer rather than cluttering the question.</p>

3,"<p>Although computer graphics can be seen as part of programming, or part of game development, there are aspects that most programmers will not necessarily be good at or even familiar with, and there are areas of computer graphics not used by most game developers, with conflicting requirements and priorities. Computer graphics questions <em>can</em> be answered elsewhere, but the answers received may not be good ones. This is worse than no answer at all.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you ask about offline rendering on Cooking, you will get close votes and no answer.</li>
<li>If you ask about offline rendering on Stack Overflow or Game Dev you may get answers that get upvotes but are misleading or wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h1>An example: Perlin noise questions</h1>

<p>I asked about a <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/250/why-is-it-twice-as-expensive-to-make-a-noise-function-that-can-be-tiled"" title=""Why is it twice as expensive to make a noise function that can be tiled?"">common technique which seemed counterintuitive when I examined it</a>. This technique is a commonly suggested approach which can be found in various places online and could easily be mistaken for best practice or a standard method. This gives the potential to provide a Stack Overflow answer that looks right and gets upvotes. However, the answer on our site shows that this commonly suggested approach is not only far less efficient but also noticeably visually inferior to a much simpler approach.</p>

<h1>Expert voters</h1>

<p>We need not only expert askers and answerers, but expert voters otherwise voting is swayed by what sounds plausible and rewards the wrong answers. Asking on Stack Overflow may give a non-expert's answer next to a graphics expert's answer. However, it is voting that decides which goes to the top and seems plausible. If the voters are not graphics experts the non-expert answer may end up at the top. The Perlin noise example shows that even backing up with links to an established method elsewhere doesn't guarantee the right answer. So we need a community of graphics voters.</p>

<h1>Is computer graphics handled well elsewhere?</h1>

<p>Graphics is a broad area with only some of it being on topic on Game Dev. Stack Overflow seems more likely to contain the scope, but are questions there answered well? Looking through, my impression is that the answer is ""sometimes"". There are graphics questions answered very well, and there are others that have sat unanswered or with just a link to questionable or unclear material.</p>

<p>Even though our question rate is low, questions here are seeing more voting and better answers than some of the similar questions on the same topics on Stack Overflow. Note this only applies to <em>some</em> - we can't compete with the questions that got popular there. This also can't be a meaningful comparison until we get enough questions.</p>

<p>This is relevant to the second bullet point about a parent site failing to attract that audience. There are questions that are on topic on Stack Overflow, but they don't get much attention there due to being swamped (not every question that is on topic here would be tagged ""graphics"" on Stack Overflow, so graphics experts on Stack Overflow won't necessarily see them).</p>

<h1>Our wider scope</h1>

<p>We also seem to allow questions here that help with understanding, rather than just fixing code. It's been interesting to see the scope develop (and I've been testing the boundaries with borderline questions), and it seems focused but broader than I'd expected. I think this matches the more specific range of our still very broad subject. We cover more aspects of a narrower field than Stack Overflow. We have become a graphics community which answers more than just Stack Overflow questions about graphics.</p>

<h1>Combining two communities</h1>

<p>In addition to feeling that we benefit from separating our graphics community from the vastness of Stack Overflow, I also feel there is a <em>lot</em> to be gained from having a site that caters to both realtime and offline graphics. These are two quite separate communities (for example realtime games programmers and offline animation programmers) but despite taking different approaches and having different priorities, there is so much overlap in expertise and perspective that I expect each to benefit the other. I want to be able to ask questions that are exposed to experts from both sides, rather than just getting the game developers' side. Also, topics gradually drift from offline into game dev as software and hardware improve, which is another reason to bring these two communities together.</p>

<h1>Our little community</h1>

<p>All this being said, our community (active users) is small, <em>even for a private beta</em>, and our question rate is low (although <em>far</em> better than our previous private beta, even if you exclude my questions since I've been much more question focused this time).</p>

<p>We have a huge number of users who committed and signed up, and are on our user list, but have <strong>not asked, answered or voted even once</strong>, either on main or meta. These ghost users suggest that we made it to private beta artificially, our numbers buoyed up by people who are interested in a computer graphics site existing, but not interested in contributing to it (even by voting).</p>

<p>My impression is that there <strong><em>are</em></strong> good reasons for having a computer graphics site rather than just asking on other Stack Exchange sites, but before we can make it happen we need a community big enough to keep up the momentum. What we have at the moment is high quality but slow. Faster than some of the other failed private betas, but not quite enough questions to seem sustainable.</p>

<p>Remember that you can <a href=""https://computergraphics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/90/do-you-know-more-experts"">invite new members</a> to join us and help with our question count, and you can ask more questions yourself (especially if you've found yourself focusing on answers so far).</p>

<h1>Experts and askers - a false divide</h1>

<p>I think part of the problem may be that <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/74985/computer-graphics"">our user list seems to have divided into experts and askers</a>, whereas ideally the experts would also be asking. Without those questions that the experts currently think are too advanced for this site, the site will never become a place that seems advanced enough. Please don't restrict to only asking questions you know the answer to. If we get some unanswered questions, that's life. If we don't get enough questions, that's site death.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that the final decision will be affected by not only how many questions per day we manage, but whether we start to see our experts contributing questions rather than mostly answers. We obviously need the answers too, but without expert questions we're shrinking not growing.</p>

<hr>

<p>I think the claims I make here sound intuitively plausible, but what is needed for decision making is numbers to back it up. With the current size and activity of our community, I don't see how we can provide that. If we want this to be more than just guesswork, we are going to need more members and more questions.</p>

<p>One thing that gives me guarded optimism is that despite most of our questions coming from just a few people, recently there have been a number of first time questions from new people, suggesting that we could be beginning to expand. We'll need to prove that quickly if we are to make it to public beta though.</p>

3,"<p>I've noticed a few questions and answers that are high quality and valuable, but appear to have typos or missing words in places. In cases where I understand the meaning, I can simply edit to correct this. However, in many cases I'm out of my depth and simply can't guess what was intended - especially when terms are used that I am unfamiliar with.</p>

<p>It would be nice to be able to flag such posts for someone more knowledgeable to edit, rather than just ignoring them when they are beyond me.</p>

<p>So two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would it be useful to draw attention and improve such posts?</li>
<li>If so, how can we do this?</li>
</ul>

<p>We obviously don't want to use the existing flag system as that will bring mods, who shouldn't have to do all the editing...  I'm trying to think of a way that doesn't introduce too much extra effort. Maybe someone else can think of something?</p>

<p>Second - use comments, not flags. Flags are meant to draw moderator attention to problematic issues - very low quality posts, spam posts, questions that ask for opinions instead of expertise...<br>
But the situation you describe is that the posts are good, just parts of them are unclear. So ask the OP and the community to clarify - comment and  explain what is unclear. An improved post benefits all.</p>

3,"<p>We've been <a href=""https://computergraphics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/114/231"">given an extra week</a> to prove we are ready for public beta. We've had that week, and more.

<p>We certainly haven't been forgotten. I noticed recently that Robert Cartaino closed a clearly off topic question within minutes of posting, so Stack Exchange staff are obviously watching our site closely and trying to guide it in the right direction.</p>

<p>This suggests to me that we are doing <em>only just</em> well enough to survive a few more days, but not well enough to justify a public beta yet. We had a big jump up in question rate, but it's dropped again.</p>

3,"<p>While on some SEs, notably Stack Overflow, it is often sufficient for questions to contain a short code snippet, others, notable TeX/LaTeX SE, ask for a full <a href=""https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/q/228/18957"">Minimal Working Example (MWE)</a>.</p>

<p>I'm bringing this up because I saw <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/q/372/16"">this question</a> yesterday. I think it's a good question, clear and with a screenshot, very googlable and hopefully very relevant to future visitors. It even includes the shader code which is nice. However, unless someone spots an obvious problem with that handful of lines of shader, it is really hard for answerers to actually debug the issue. They'd need to set up some OpenGL boilerplate, as well as a scene to try and see if they can reproduce it. That's quite a lot to ask from people who spend their freetime helping others. And even if they did, the issue might ultimately not be in the shader and so the different boilerplate code might not exhibit the same problem.</p>

<p>If the post instead contained the simplest complete program to exhibit the problem (be it C, C++, Python or JavaScript+WebGL), anyone could just get the programming running and play around with it.</p>

<p>So my question is, what should our policy on this be? Should all questions which are about specific code include a full MWE? If so, how do we point (especially new) users to what exactly is required for an answerable question?</p>

<p>(PS: If we do want all specific-code questions to contain MWEs, <a href=""https://computergraphics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/26/16"">Stack Snippets</a> would be even more useful.)</p>

3,"<p>Not every question here will be a code question, but for those that are, clearly a minimal working example is better, so we need to decide how to respond to questions that have code that is longer than necessary, or shorter than necessary. Both cases are a problem: Too much code is more work for our experts (not just taking advantage of their time but also depriving other questions of their attention). Too little code means the problem no longer occurs and so also wastes time.</p>

<p>If we comment to indicate what needs to change, and then leave it to the asker, some askers will ignore the comment and never touch their question again, leaving us with an unanswered question to forever clutter our question list. The same goes for downvoting questions that aren't ready to be answered (and I don't like the idea of downvoting well-meaning questions).</p>

<p><strong>I think the answer is to vote to close such questions. This puts them on hold until they are ready to be answered, so other questions don't suffer from loss of attention.</strong> Once the code is ready for experts to look at, the question can be reopened and answered much more efficiently. If we can emphasise that this is not a bad thing, just a natural part of the life cycle of a question to ensure the best answers, then hopefully everyone will see voting to close as positive and we can get such questions closed quickly, dealt with, and then reopened quickly. This also solves the problem of askers who never come back - their questions will remain closed unless someone else chooses to edit the question to rescue it.</p>

<p>The decision on where to draw the line will be a subjective one. I wouldn't want to close a question for having one punctuation mark more than strictly necessary to reproduce the problem. But I think we should have a policy of closing questions that are in need of a Minimum Working Example, and then the votes of the community will decide where the line is on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Since the problem questions will often be from new users who are not yet familiar with our site, let's aim to give comments that explain why the question is being put on hold (sounds less final than ""closed""), and mention that it can be reopened once it has been improved.</p>

3,"<p>I think we should only ask for a Minimal Working Example, if it is necessary. Especially in our context, drawing and shading a triangle using the favorite API can already be a huge amount of code. Huge in the context of our Q&amp;A site. Moreover, in most cases it will be completely superfluous to have some code for e.g. the Main (Game) Loop and all the API setup stuff in the question. </p>

<p>And even if it actually is there and is actually truncated to the tiniest amount of code necessary to compile and run and experience the problem: You'll soon see that you can't compile it, because e.g. you're using OS X instead of Windows and thus using some other compiler, have different headers and some things are simply not available on all systems, because everyone likes to define his own ""standard"".</p>

<p>This might work for (La)TeX, because as far as I have seen there are no big dependencies on the environment and the MWE is probably quite short in most cases. But in CG context this would simply be too much code.</p>

<p>If you have a question about a shader, then in most cases shader code will be sufficient. If you have a question about weirdly misplaced objects, then parts of your scene graph will probably be enough. Everything unrelated to the problem will only distract from the problem. </p>

<p>Edit, just to make this clear: Yes, the code should be <strong>stripped down to the minimum</strong>. But only ask for a copy/paste/compile/run-example (MWE), if necessary.</p>

<p>Why Computer Graphics SE?</p>

<ul>
<li>I've been very excited about this SE and have eagerly awaited the beta phase over the past year. I've been following the proposal from very early on and provided several well-received example questions which have been made into well-received real questions by now.</li>
<li>I've been a computer graphics enthusiast for several years and will be starting PhD studies in the field this October. I really want to see this site succeed, because I think that an information resource with SE's high quality is still missing on the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why me?</p>

<ul>
<li>I have been a moderator (pro tempore) on <a href=""https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/"">Programming Puzzles &amp; Code Golf</a> for the past 5 months, so I do already have moderation experience on a beta site. Judging by the moderate workload on PPCG and my high activity, I don't think moderating two sites will be detrimental to my contributions to either site.</li>
<li>My <a href=""https://computergraphics.meta.stackexchange.com/users"">meta participation</a> on this site is very high, and I've been trying to work through the review queues as actively as I could. My questions and answers on meta hopefully show that I'm very interested in building this community while ensuring that our content is of high quality.</li>
<li>I'm active <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/26589/the-cornell-box"">in our chat room</a> and I wish more of the other users were as well. ;)</li>
<li>I don't like to praise to myself, so for some words about my person, I refer you to <a href=""https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4929/8478"">my nomination on PPCG</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, let me pre-emptively address the stains on my record:</p>

<ul>
<li>My activity during this private beta has dropped off after the first two weeks. This was mostly because I was travelling, and I fully intend to pick up my previous activity levels (and have already begun to do so).</li>
<li>I haven't written a single answer on main yet. While I have tried to contribute to the community with a number of questions which I hope will be of use to future visitors, I haven't done much graphics-related work recently. Therefore, I felt a bit out of the loop to provide sufficiently authoritative answers compared to our more expert users. With the PhD I'll be starting, I hope that this will change very soon and that I'll build the confidence to contribute to this community with answers as well.</li>

<p>I'm also a participant on <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!profile/comp.lang.c/APn2wQdEi5QhcIEsQrxdk6niB-YTnHceZ8BNwOwDaO1mP9ZUb0vnXhb5R0jLrzuhhxfJbB0dlzQl"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">usenet</a> (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/topic/xpost-discuss/EwUA6NmwxQQ/discussion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">highlights</a>), particularly <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!profile/comp.lang.postscript/APn2wQfG1ZzXc7Ni-ghXKm3ZuK5wGvApQfCNe9bOpNameh20m-E6tuTCc-_vDKvaSGDIqBw9XRLA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">comp.lang.postscript</a> (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/topic/xpost-discuss/KJCesIt-AGw/discussion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">highlights</a>).

<p>*I can often transform this into perseverance.</p>

<p>I would tend to refrain from voting to close if a question can be saved by editing. This might distinguish me somewhat from Martin, who must maintain a more severe policy over on code-golf (necessary there to prevent ""dangling answers"" which are only valid for a particular (early) revision of a question (challenge)). I feel we can be a little more lenient (and less discouraging) here to new users.</p>

Is this a type of question that we want to see here?

3,"<p>I would not be completely against such questions, however they should be different than the one you linked. </p>

<p>That question is asking for the definition of two words that are indeed used in the CG context but not in counter-intuitive ways. A dictionary is enough to answer that question. If not, a <strong><em>very</em></strong> quick Google search would have sufficed. </p>

<p>There are as you say terms that are more specific to computer graphics, with subtler meanings than the basic dictionary-definition. With those I'd be fine, but only if put in the right context and if asked in a ""why is this technique called such?"" fashion rather than ""what does it mean?"" </p>

<p>All in all, I would say we should evaluate that on a per-question basis rather than have a rule set in stone. </p>

3,"<p>I broadly agree with Nero on this, but I'd like to clarify one point. I don't think it's necessarily clear at the outset when a question is ""about specific code"" and when it's a matter of general understanding. And ratchet freak is correct that with next-generation graphics APIs, a ""minimal example"" may not be very minimal at all.</p>

<p>A MWE is the gold standard for a code-based question, no dispute there. This is especially true with something like APIs which are basically complex state machines. However OpenGL, even more useful than seeing the code would be seeing the state of the machine right at the point where an API call did something that you didn't expect. That's more useful than tracing through code, IMO.</p>

<p>Besides, what if the MWE includes multiple kilobytes of model data?</p>

<p>So here's my suggestion:</p>

<ul>
<li>At a minimum, you need to include enough code (and screenshots) so that potential answerers can understand the problem.</li>
<li>Questioners should expect that more information (including more code) may be asked for, and that there may be no answer without a MWE.</li>
<li>For OpenGL (and anything else relevant), we may want to write some code which dumps the state, put the code somewhere, and then ask people to run that at various points in the code and post the dump. Something like OpenGLDebugFrameDump from UE4 if you've seen that.</li>
</ul>

3,"<p>I think allowing “define this for me”-type questions, especially, as cifz says, without context, risks letting the site turn into more of a disorganized wiki or a specialized dictionary than a Q&amp;A environment.</p>

<p>The most useful answers I’ve seen on other Stack Exchange sites (and this one, so far) have been the ones where the question was about a specific problem someone was having, not generalized “teach me about this” exchanges. There are a <strong>lot</strong> of graphics terms someone might ask about, and allowing the “define [thing]”s from A to Z to continue seems like it’ll drown out the more valuable (IMO) questions being asked by people who’re trying to accomplish a particular task.</p>

<hr />

<p>As for software recommendation questions in the CG area: Such questions <em>could</em> attract opinionated answers and/or spam. So we should carefully define how should questions should be asked and answered to be acceptable. </p>

<p>I personally don't want to see questions like <em>Which graphics API should I use?</em> with answers screaming <em>OpenGL/Metal/D3D/... is best!!11oneeleven</em> for obvious reasons. But for example questions asking about solving a CG problem leading to <em>objective</em> answers recommending different libraries can be very good and useful. However, it must not lead to flame wars.</p>

<p>Maybe such questions should be related to an actual precise problem. In other words, maybe the core of the question should be a problem or alike and not the software/tool/library/etc.</p>

3,"<h2>My answer is <em>sometimes</em></h2>
<p>I think recommendation questions should reflect our scope.</p>
<p>Questions about <em>using</em> animation and modelling software are not in scope, so asking for a recommendation for such software should be off topic.</p>
<p>Questions about <em>writing</em> software and working with APIs and GPUs are in scope, so asking about the suitability of a specific language, API, GPU model should be on topic.</p>
<p>This should still be a specific question with sufficient detail. The following would not be acceptable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the best GPU?</p>
<p>Which language is best for graphics?</p>
<p>What software should I use for animation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But asking if a specific piece of software or hardware is compatible with a specific computer graphics task is on topic.</p>
<p>I also think that questions without a specific piece of software or hardware in mind should be on topic <strong>provided the question provides sufficient detail to promote objective answers that can back up each recommendation with factual explanation.</strong></p>
<p>This way the answers can be supported by expert knowledge rather than just being a fashion contest.</p>
<hr />
<p>As for the specific linked question, I see this as a question about working with specific types of computer graphics objects in a well specified way, and asking whether that task has already been automated elsewhere to save duplicating work. That seems a good fit for our site.</p>
<p>This decision will always be subjective (it's areas like this that are the reason we need a community of experts voting, rather than just universal rules). In this case my opinion is swayed by the fact that this is clearly a question from a programmer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm in the process of porting part of this system to Three.js</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that:</p>
<ol>
<li>This question is more likely to be relevant to future programmers and researchers.</li>
<li>The question poster is someone who will be inclined to ask (and answer) programming questions, and benefit this community.</li>
</ol>
<p>For these reasons I think this question belongs here.</p>

  <p>In my opinion the question you linked is off-topic because it is about modeling, which afaik is not in the scope here.</p>

3,"<p>I agree that the linked question is probably off-topic, but the reason why I think this is the case is that it's a toss up between ""questions about software tools"" and ""primarily opinion-based"".</p>

<p>My primary rule of thumb is that if you can publish a paper on it in SIGGRAPH or JCGT, it's on topic in cg.se. So to the extent that modelling is about algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and even physics (e.g. winged-edge vs half-edge, CSG operations on polygon meshes, discrete differential geometry, animation blending and interpolation, solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations on triangular meshes), modelling is on topic.</p>

<p>I don't know where to draw the line, and I suspect we'll know it when we see it. On APIs, I broadly agree with Qix's answer, but I can't help thinking that if questions about the subtleties of OpenGL are on topic, then questions about the subtleties of Collada are also on topic.</p>

<p>Otherwise we are going to have a constant flood of off topic questions in the future. So easy to understand rules of thumb are sorely needed. </p>

All these things were the case in last year's private beta and have been consistently the case again this year.</p>

<p>I was particularly impressed with a question for which Nathan performed testing of two different approaches in order to give an evidence based answer, rather than just answering based on intuition. <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/65/what-is-the-optimal-radius-of-gaussian-distribution-for-determining-pixel-colour/75#75"">This answer</a> links to the blog post that developed from that original answer last time around.

Because of this, Nathan is someone I would be happy to accept a decision from, even if not in my favour.</p>

<p>On top of this Nathan referred a large number of new members during commitment phase, making a big difference in helping us reach private beta.

3,"<p>Last Friday, I noticed a question with a title <em>Is this a mistake in the Wikipedia article for ...?</em>, which already was the second question in this style.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/361/is-this-a-mistake-in-the-wikipedia-article-for-lambertian-reflectance?s=2|0.5008"">Is a Lambertian reflector illuminated by a smaller fraction of the incident radiation when it&#39;s tilted?</a></li>

</ol>

<p>While the actual question in these questions are fine, I'd like to discuss the style, on how the question is asked. In my opinion, we should be careful, to not have too many questions asking directly <em>Is this a mistake in the Wikipedia article?</em>, because this site should not become a discussion page for Wikipedia articles and the articles may/will change. Furthermore, the information you gain from the question title is basically non-existent. </p>

<p>Yes, this may sound overly concerned, as there are only two such questions, but to quote from the latter one it starts with</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the style of trichoplax' question, I want to talk about yet another Wikipedia article: Radiosity (computer graphics). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of discussing an article, I think these questions should focus on the content, even if asking about some source/Wikipedia to be wrong. And there is another example question that does this far better:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/367/why-is-recursion-forbidden-in-opencl"">Why is recursion forbidden in OpenCL?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In this question, also a Wikipedia article is questioned, but it focuses on the content. The question whether the article is wrong or not has an inferior role.</p>

<p>Should we try to convert the two <em>Is this a mistake...</em> questions into the style of the latter one? Or am I actually overly concerned about these questions?</p>

3,"<p>If I just want to link to a paper, blog post, presentation etc. that I think might be relevant, I post it as a comment, not as an answer. Although pointing people to external resources can be helpful, that in itself is not an answer.</p>

<p>A good answer can certainly refer to external links, but it should at least offer a paragraph or two of explanation <em>in the answerer's own words</em> of the technique and why/how it's applicable to the specific question being asked. This isn't just about ensuring that the answer remains useful even if the link evaporates (although that is important); it's also a way to demonstrate that the answerer has actually thought about it and not just typed some keywords into Google.  A good example is <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/a/62/48"">John Calsbeek's answer on spherical noise</a>.</p>

<p>A good answer can also be a ""literature survey"" that has several links, covering a range of different possible techniques or algorithms. In this case the answerer can't explain everything in detail as the answer would be huge, but they should still try to put things in context and compare/contrast the different approaches, so the reader can understand how all the links relate to each other, and make decisions what to investigate further.  <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/a/1451/48"">Krzysztof Narkowicz's answer on LOD techniques</a> is a great example of this.</p>

<p>The answer referred to in this question doesn't provide any of the answerer's own expertise and moreover does not even clearly cite the pasted text as being from somewhere else. The link to the actual paper only appears in a comment! It is simply lazy, one step above outright plagiarism, and should be deleted. I have voted to do so.</p>

3,"<p>I voted to close as ""primarily opinion-based"", even though I think it's a pretty interesting and valuable question (I even posted an answer to it), because I don't see how you could decide objectively which answer is the best.  For instance, I recommended Inkscape and someone else recommended Adobe Illustrator. Which program is ""better"" for making diagrams with is a matter of personal taste and experience, as well as access to the software.</p>

<p>It's also not really on-topic, except accidentally, to the extent that creating diagrams might call on some graphics knowledge, or involve a little programming. You could imagine many communities on SE having this same question, but it would not be remotely on-topic in most of them.</p>

<p>Migrating to meta might be the best thing to do with this question. I wouldn't want to get rid of it entirely, as I do think it is valuable, and meta is more OK with opinion-based questions and answers.</p>

3,"<p>I'm going to prefix what I say by nothing that I actually agree with Nero. A good question asks a specific question about the content (e.g. ""Why is there a cosine factor?"" in the case of the Lambertian reflection question). If the questioner believes there to be a mistake in Wikipedia, then by all means bring this up as the source of confusion.</p>

<p>I'm sympathetic to the form of the question, because we do try to encourage <a href=""http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">smart questions</a>, and that means doing your research first. The very question ""is there a mistake in Wikipedia?"" is good evidence that the questioner has been doing precisely that.</p>

<p>Having said that, I'd like to broaden the meta-question a bit.</p>

<p>To the extent that SE would like to become a body of questions and answers, whether or not Wikipedia has a mistake is a short-term thing. With any luck, it will get fixed soon, perhaps even as a result of the discussion here.</p>

<p>But what if it's a standard textbook or reference book, like Foley/van Dam/etc, or the OpenGL red book? These are, in a sense, more ""permanent"" than Wikipedia.</p>

<p>My view is that good formatting is an important part of a good question or answer, so my opinion is that an edit to improve or fix formatting <strong>is valid</strong>.</p>

<p>Besides, using a blockquote to highlight a title can cause confusion as you say, but also much more serious problems if the styles of the site change. There are specific markups for titles/headings, so we can expect that those will remain consistent even if the site style is changed.</p>

There is a comment suggesting that the question is unclear, which is a valid close reason, but I don't know whether both the downvotes are for this reason.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be useful to have a discussion about downvotes and close votes and the purpose of each. I see both as an important part of curating the site.</p>

<p>Aside from the differences in their purpose, a significant difference that may affect motivation is that downvotes are completely anonymous, whereas close votes are openly visible (at least once a question has been put on hold).</p>

<p>As the lack of anonymity could potentially make some people wary of close voting, I'd like to see close votes emphasised as something essential to the running of the site. I want people who vote to close to be commended for it, whether we agree with the close reason or not. The close/reopen cycle will take care of that. Downvotes are also important, but they do not have the effect of putting a question on hold to ensure it can be improved before answers come in.</p>

<p><strong>How does the community feel about the difference between downvotes and close votes? Is there any specific guidance we should be giving?</strong></p>

<p>I ask in particular because our Stack Exchange site has a significant proportion of members who are not familiar with the Stack Exchange model, so that both downvotes and close votes will be new to them.</p>

3,"<p>As recently <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/24324038#24324038"">discussed in chat</a>, we have a relatively small number of users with sufficient reputation to process the review queues for close votes and low quality posts, and a smaller number still who are actively engaged in the review queues. This means that items are stuck in the review queues for far longer than is healthy.</p>

<p><strong>In the past (although very rarely), the rep levels for such privileges have been temporarily modified for some new sites that are not yet ready for the standard public beta rep levels.

3,"<h3>Computer vision is off topic except where it overlaps with computer graphics</h3>

<p>Computer vision is in some sense the opposite of computer graphics - going from image to description rather than from description to image. However, despite this intuitive difference, computer vision contains many aspects of computer graphics, and computer graphics often requires techniques which overlap with computer vision. The line between the two will therefore always be blurred.</p>

<p><strong><em>There will be many questions for which is it is clear that they are not about computer graphics. I believe that the numberplate recognition question is one of these, and I have voted to close it as off topic.</em></strong></p>

<h3>Grey areas</h3>

<p>Although recognition questions are off topic, questions about construction of a model based on measured data such as photographs or laser scans are in some cases on topic, and are an important part of work and research in computer graphics.</p>

<p>It is hard to intuitively describe the difference, in order to guide people who are considering voting to close. What might help is to think of recognition as a categorisation problem rather than a construction problem. </p>

<p>This certainly won't provide a clear outcome for all the grey area questions, which is why we need human close voters rather than an algorithm or a strict rule.</p>

3,"<p>I'd like to bump this discussion along with stating my own opinion about homework questions. Not because I'm a moderator now, but rather because I've recently seen a close vote reason on a homework-style question stating that it should be closed because it is a homework question (and nothing more).</p>
<hr />
<p>I think, most if not all homework-style questions are asked, because the author has difficulties applying or understanding an underlying problem. And because of this, the author can not solve the assignment and asks for help.</p>
<p>Now the question can be asked like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my course we have the following assignment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried X and Y but don't understand how to Z, because...</p>
<p>How do I do Z with respect to X and Y?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which deserves an answer, in my opinion. However, if it is asked like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Task: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam...</p>
<p>Please help?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it does not look like a good question. And it most likely isn't, because often the question is too broad, unclear or both, because there are too many aspects in the task that could be the actual problem of the author.</p>
<p>And there will be questions in between these two extremes. But we should aim to turn the homework-style questions to be in the style of the former example. And if it is, it does not matter anymore whether or not it is a homework related question.</p>
<hr />
<p>While researching how other sites handle homework questions, I found some paragraphs which I'd like to share:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't flag questions as &quot;homework.&quot; There's nothing moderators can do about that.</p>
<p>There's a specific admonishment in the Help Center:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Questions asking for homework help must include a summary of the work you've done so far to solve the problem, and a description of the difficulty you are having solving it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a user is clearly just trying to get their homework answered without any effort on their part, I typically close the question, putting that description in the custom close reason.</p>
<p><sub><sup>Source: <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/253793/1564895"">Robert Harveys answer</a> on Meta Stack Overflow</sup></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a great way to close questions that are of the <code>plz give me the codez</code> and alike type.</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Make a good faith attempt to solve the problem yourself first. If we can't see enough work on your part your question will likely be booed off the stage; it will be voted down and closed.</li>
<li>Ask about specific problems with your existing implementation. If you can't do that yet, try some more of your own work first or searching for more general help; your professor is likely to be a better resource at this stage than Stack Overflow.</li>
<li>Admit that the question is homework. Trying to hide it will just get the question closed faster. Do not use a “homework” tag, but mention it in the question text if relevant (you can structure your question this way: “How can I do …?

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Ask about the specific concept that gives you trouble</p>
<p>We expect you to narrow down the problem to the particular concept that's giving you trouble and ask about that specifically. That produces a question that is more relevant to others who might be having the same problem, as well as probably more interesting to answer. As a side effect it shows that you're not just being lazy and trying to get us to do your work for you.</p>
<p>The best way to produce a focused, specific question is to show your work. Explain what you've been able to figure out so far and how you did it. Showing your work will help us gauge where you are having problems: if it is a technical thing near the end, a short to the point answer will suffice; if it is some fundamental problem with understanding the subject, somebody will then write a longer, more detailed response. It will also prevent people from spending a lot of time going over ground that you have already covered or understand well already.</p>
<p>It's not enough to just show your work and ask where you went wrong. If you just need someone to check your work, you can always seek out a friend, classmate, or teacher. As a rule of thumb, a good conceptual question should be useful even to someone who isn't looking at the problem you happen to be working on. Of course, it's still good to include the text of your problem, just in case (more on that a few paragraphs down).</p>

3,"<p>Possibly, it may depend. After some thinking this must be offtopic. Asking for how to implement a graph library drawing internals is almost certainly on topic.</p>

<p>Another thing is: Is it constructive to ask this here? There are forums that most certainly would answer faster in this case.</p>

<p>Anyway what we do need is some sort of litmus test for whether or not something is graphics related. Quite obviously it's not enough that you want to draw a picture, not even a nice one. Because otherwise every graphics design question could be applicable here.</p>

<p>Also lets look at our on topics page it states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions about a specific graphics API</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are on topic. So that means this is possibly on topic. But the question is about scientific plotting and as such its not really drawing anything new just using precanned graphing functions. Otherwise most Mathematica questiosn would be on topic too.</p>

<p>I would say that the question does not really relate to graphics drawing but rather sending wrong data to the drawing algorithm. And while it may be debugging its still not enough about graphics.</p>

<p>Finally the deciding factor is, specific graphing tools, should be offtopic same way as using a specific modeling application is offtopic. In this case its like asking how to do this and that in maya, only this and that here is R and modelling is the thing he does and graphing is just the reflection of the modeling.</p>

<p>In essence the DCMA complaint is for this purpose. You can do whatever you like but you have no obligation to do anything about this matter. We do not even know if it is violating any copyright.</p>

<p>* for example code snippets on stackexchange rarely get copyright in my jurisdiction as they do not qualify as copyrightable works unless they are significant codebases (30 lines rarely is a significant codebase). On the other hand publishers have natural moral rights to whatever they write, so I will need to attribute that code no matter what the license of stackexchange says. If its copyrightable it may be copyrightable as a textual work in which case i can obtain a license form the appropriate local trade organization, on your behalf. After having done this you have no copyright claim I've handled my end.

<li><p>In fact, asking for an academic reference for a specific known fact is <em>not at all</em> like asking for a resource. The asker doesn't need that reference to do some <em>other</em> task. There is no unstated underlying problem that the asker is <em>acually</em> interested in solving. There is no underlying problem such that if someone here helped him solve <em>that</em> problem, this would render the request for an off-site resource a moot point. On the contrary, locating a reference <em>is</em> the underlying problem. It is needed for its own sake, rather than to resolve some other issue.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that is being requested is exactly the kind of fact that an expert in computer graphics might well be uniquely qualified to know. And if the expert does know it, the answer will be definitive and brief.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Number of users seems to be raising somewhat constant across time:</p>

3,"<p>While there are definitely things to improve here, I don't think we need to be worried (too much).</p>

<p>On Meta SE, there is a post by the Community Management about their view on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites"">Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The TL;DR:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.</li>
  <li>If a public beta site does not produce consistently helpful content, and lacks the caretakers needed for flags and spam to get handled and our Be Nice policy to be upheld, it will be closed.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>We do get a steady amount of new users (about 40 - 50 per week) and also continuously get new posts. The average numbers of new questions and answers oscillate roughly between 1.5 and 3.0 new questions and answers (each) per day. I'm looking at the questions/answers per day numbers here, because other publicly shown metrics also show these numbers. For example, <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites#questionsperday"">the list of all sites</a> of the SE network or the <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/74985/computer-graphics"">Area51 page</a>. This is not bad - there are a lot of sites in the same range of questions per day.</p>

<p>And you mentioned the quite low answered percentage. That's actually a metric I'm a bit concerned about and I'd like to get that back up above the 90%. We need to get more people to answer questions and I count myself to that group who should answer more. Also, our number of visits per day is very low, when <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic"">compared to other sites</a>.</p>

<p>One thing we could try, is to create some community ads to display on other sites. These could bring new users to our site and hopefully also new users who ask and answer questions. Quite recently, we had a few questions that lasted a bit longer in the Hot Network Questions list, which temporarily boosted visits and new user counts.</p>

<p>While <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a> is a very large community and it makes sense to consider <a href=""https://codereview.stackexchange.com/"">Code Review</a> to require its own dedicated website, I think the same isn't true for a narrow field like Computer Graphics.

<p>On the opposite, <a href=""https://codereview.stackexchange.com/"">Code Review</a> probably wouldn't be the best place to as for graphics programming related code review, since insightful comments require some expertise, or at least experience, in graphics programming.</p>

<p>Moreover, I think this is typically the kind of discussion where people with experience in the field (AAA game, etc.) can contribute greatly, beyond answers that could be found in papers.</p>

<p>We probably want to put a limit to the breadth of asked reviews, but I suppose common sense will tell when to use the <em>""Question is too broad""</em> flag.</p>

<p>Graphics programming being a fairly specialized topic, some of these numbers probably can't be improved by much: there are only that many people doing graphics programming anyway.</p>

<p>But some could, and should, definitely be improved. After a long hiatus, <strong>I answered a few questions last week, and skyrocketed to 1st rank for this quarter</strong>. I think it should have taken me a lot more activity to reach that point.</p>

<p>In my opinion a simple effort at reviewing questions without an answer would already do a lot for the community; 90% questions answered doesn't seem far. We definitely more avid users, but I'm not sure how to address this: a decent answer can easily take a lot of time, and there are simply questions we don't have an answer to.</p>

  <p><em>You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!</em></p>
  
  <p>To show that this is true, they've even created a <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship"">badge for voting up competing answers (called ""Sportsmanship"")</a>.</p>
  
  <p>If you think an answer is <em>useful</em>, vote it up.  If you think an answer is <em>not useful</em>, vote it down.  Either way, <strong>vote</strong>!</p>
  
  <p>If you need help on writing answers, the meta post <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question"">How do I write a good answer to a question?</a> will help you out.</p>
  
  <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
  
  <p>If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.</p>
  
  <p>To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/"">Vote Early, Vote Often</a></p>
  
  <h3>Encourage others to vote!</h3>
  
  <p>Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:</p>
  
  <blockquote>

As the question asks about the meaning of $E_L$ in an equation, I've edited to show MathJax in the title, so it is clear that a subscript is intended.</p>

<p>This shows correctly for me, on both laptop and mobile. The font size for $E_L$ shows slightly smaller for a fraction of a second on mobile with a slower connection.</p>

<p>I find this clearer than just saying EL, and even if it displayed as <code>$E_L$</code> due to a very slow connection it would be fairly clear what it means. I can imagine this being less clear for longer strings of LaTeX, so I wanted to see discussion of whether we should have a rule for this, or just judge it case by case.</p>

<p>Does anyone find the title of the example question particularly uncomfortable due to the change during loading? Are there any problems elsewhere that I haven't thought of? I've heard search engines mentioned in the past but I wouldn't expect that to be particularly relevant in this case - the EL won't mean much to a search engine either way, and the rest of the title and body contains useful plain text information.

3,"<p>Written material has been one of the most widespread methods to convey knowledge during the last millennia.<br>
It started on a variety of objects, but we mainly benefit from it via printed books.<br>
I myself still have a special taste in physical books: you can use them everywhere it's bright enough, can add personal notes on it with those useful tools called ""pens"".<br>
Nowadays, information has increasingly taken a digital quality. Nevertheless, we still tremendously rely on digital <em>books</em>.  </p>

<p>It seems that this questions:<br>

3,"<p>This is not a campaign against books. Note that it is not <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"" title=""On topic page in the help system"">on topic</a> to ask for recommendations for any off site resources, whether books or not.</p>

<p>My comment on the question referred to books only because the question specifically asked for books rather than online resources. The close reason displayed below the question is more general:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions asking us to <strong>recommend or find a book, tool, software, tutorial or other off-site resource</strong> are off-topic for Computer Graphics as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe your problem or need and the steps, if any, you've taken to solve it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of us own and use books, and this rule is not an indication of any disapproval of books. Books and other off site resources are often recommended in answers here. We just don't allow requesting such recommendations - they only come as part of an answer to a specific question.</p>

<h1>Elsewhere on Stack Exchange</h1>

<p>Note that most Stack Exchange sites have a rule against recommendation questions. Meta Stack Exchange has a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/158809/why-are-shopping-list-questions-bad"" title=""Why are shopping list questions bad?"">question calling them ""Shopping list questions""</a>. That mostly refers to Stack Overflow but the arguments apply elsewhere too. The second answer there goes into a lot more detail and gives a way around the rule, which I think makes it clearer why the rule makes sense.</p>

<p>The exceptions are <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/"" title=""Software Recommendations Stack Exchange"">Software Recommendations</a> and <a href=""https://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/"" title=""Hardware Recommendations Stack Exchange"">Hardware Recommendations</a>, but even there questions have to be specific and give as much detail as possible. Both sites have strict quality guidelines explaining what can and can't be asked in a recommendation question.</p>

<h1>Asking in chat is very welcome</h1>

3,"<p>Yes, it's always good to edit a question so that it can be reopened. In the case of splitting the question, we might not need to edit the original question at all: just ask a new series of appropriately-scoped questions. I'd expect that in a couple of cases they might be self-answered too: asking really good questions is much easier if you already understand the topic.</p>

3,"<p>I think in many cases (and in the linked example) too many subquestions means that what is being requested is a tutorial, rather than an answer. Requests for existing off site resources, including tutorials, are off topic. I see no reason to treat requests to write new tutorials any differently.</p>

<p>The Q&amp;A format works well because questions are specific, which makes answers comparable. This means that asking a computer graphics question not only gets you a variety of expert answers, but also meaningful expert voting, to highlight the most useful answer. The larger the number of subquestions that are squeezed into a question post, the wider will be the variety of answers that are worthy of upvotes. This means that votes from an expert community no longer distinguish the best answers, making the question nearer to a forum thread or a blog. Forums and blogs serve a different purpose, and allowing them here sacrifices the benefits of expert voting.</p>

<p>I'm deliberately focusing on the need to recognise tutorial questions as off topic, rather than on what to do with a question after it is closed.</p>

<p>Anyone is free to post new questions, and questions will be judged on their merit, rather than whether their inspiration came from a real world problem or a subsection of a previous closed question.</p>

<p>What is important to make this site useful is a community of experts who are prepared to downvote and vote to close, to keep the body of questions relevant and specific. Provided we maintain this, questions will continue to come in and the site and the community will both continue to grow. There is no need to worry about a question that is closed and not edited.</p>

<p>We can be friendly and helpful when putting questions on hold, and encourage editing to allow reopening, but for those question authors who choose not to edit, letting the question stay closed is a natural part of how a Q&amp;A site works.</p>

<p>Everyone should feel free to suggest improvements to closed questions, or to ask new related questions that better fit the site. However, please do not see this as a requirement. Having closed questions is not a bad sign - in fact I see it as a sign of good health of the site. It means we are being discerning and are not desperate for questions.</p>

3,"<p>Should the name of the Stack Exchange become ""Computer Graphics &amp; Programming"" or something more specific?</p>

<p>Each day I notice more and more people posting questions regarding graphic design or actual 3D modeling topics. I think specifying the name clearly might make it more clear that some people are on the wrong website. That could help save time for the mod's having to go and close the questions themselves if they don't get posted in the first place.</p>

3,"<p>In the question <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/5298/display-partial-png"">Display partial PNG?</a> the problem is not to access the PNG file format in the way usually used for computer graphics, but to access a truncated file in a way it was not designed for.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that questions about computer graphics file formats are on topic in general (please make that a separate meta question if there's any disagreement on that). This meta question is just about whether they are still on topic in this non standard usage which seems to relate less to computer graphics.</p>

<p>Should such questions be part of our scope?</p>

3,"<p>I'm initially inclined to say ""no"", because it's in an area of overlap with SO and seems more likely to get a good answer over there. But I think that's quite specific to this question in particular. If it were about (say) abusing the PNG format to store a shadow map, I think that would be entirely suitable for us.</p>

3,"<p>The fact that the question is about the PNG format, or a format image for that matter, seems completely anecdotic; it could have been pretty much any container (with various degrees of feasibility).</p>

<p>Moreover there is little overlap between the skills required to provide a good answer to that question, and the skills required to be an expert in computer graphics. There is a risk that this question will just sit there without a quality answer.</p>

<p>Lastly, I doubt an answer to that question would be useful to other visitors.</p>

<p>Because of this I don't think this question in particular falls within the scope, although we can take a wait-and-see attitude. That doesn't mean questions on details of file formats aren't suitable, as Dan's example shows.</p>

<li><p>People that are operating a 3D graphic application. Mainly because there is no place on the stack exchange network where they would be home.

3,"<p>We get maybe one question a week which is of the form ""please debug my code"". These questions are on-topic on Stack Overflow (assuming they fulfil the MCVE rule and describe what is wrong), but maybe they'll benefit from more specialised eyes here. Sometimes with graphics programming, an expert can look at the image and immediately see what might be wrong with the renderer that produced it. That said, often the answer to these questions is just that the questioner needs to debug in the usual ways: by stepping the code with an interactive debugger, by printing out some key variable, by changing one thing at a time, etc. The on-topic help page as it stands includes the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions about a specific graphics programming or debugging problem,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/debugging"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;debugging&#39;"" rel=""tag"">debugging</a> tag, but <a href=""https://computergraphics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/241/2041"">as discussed previously</a>, it's mainly intended for questions <em>about</em> debugging, rather than for questions <em>containing</em> debugging. As SO has found, while some debugging questions have lasting value, many of them don't, and take a lot of effort to make answerable. Too many ""debug my code"" questions may drive away the expert users we need to attract to grow the site.</p>

<p>What should we do about these questions? Here are some overlapping possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to answer them all, and make it clear they are on-topic</li>
<li>Have the same MCVE rules as SO</li>
<li>Have a canonical question ""How do I debug my graphics program?"" with general debugging advice, and close specific debugging questions as duplicates of that one</li>
<li>Say debugging-related questions are only on-topic if they can be answered without needing to see the code - i.e. if they're not asking us to debug a specific problem</li>
<li>Have a more complex rule about which debugging questions are allowed - note that the questioner needs to know whether their question fits the rule even if they don't understand the bug</li>

3,"<p>A couple days ago, I ran across <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/3742/how-to-unproject-quadrilateral-into-rectangle"">this question</a>. As you can see, it makes unusual use of spoilers and has a section marked off for ""extra tags"" because apparently the author didn't feel they were allowed to add enough. I edited it to remove the extraneous tags and changed the spoilers to just regular quotes (not that that's much better as formatting goes, I guess). It appears the author has rolled back my changes and added back their odd formatting and extra tags. I don't want to get into an edit war, so I'm just curious, is this considered OK? It seems really weird that part of the question is hidden for no good reason, and that the author had to add extra instructions on how to read it. It seems like it makes the site less useable.</p>

<p>Looking at the related Meta question <a href=""https://computergraphics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/162/should-use-of-quote-blocks-be-restricted-to-quotations"">Should Use Of Quote Blocks Be Restricted To Quotations</a>, it seems like it was valid to edit the question, but that I should have used headers instead of block quotes. Should I just flag the question? Or should I just let it go?</p>

3,"<p>There isn't a ""prohibition"" as such. The point of formatting posts correctly is to make posts more valuable to the site, and to help them achieve their goal. When a visitor to the site posts a question, they want to get answers. Formatting the question to be readable and understandable makes it more likely it will get answered, fulfilling the OP's goal. When a visitor posts an answer, they want to help others and share knowledge. Formatting the answer to be readable and understandable makes the answer accessible to more people, fulfilling the OP's goal.</p>

<p>For these reasons, editing the post in cases like the one you describe is strongly encouraged. Half-thought-through streams of consciousness don't make good posts. Some people - especially newer users who are used to a web forum where your posts are yours alone - are quite hostile to this, and we need to educate them about how SE sites work, and how editing helps them to achieve their goals and makes the site more useful for everyone.</p>

<p>If there are enough <em>rollbacks</em> to constitute an <em>edit war</em>, moderators are automatically notified of this, but it's also good to use a custom mod flag before it gets to that point. Moderators are empowered to lock posts when people are fighting over them, to reach out to individual users who don't understand how editing works on our site, and as a last resort, to suspend uesrs who are hostile or who vandalise posts.</p>

3,"<p>I like the idea of a canonical question. It would be definitely useful, as all of us sooner or later will face a complete black screen and need to learn how to debug it, and often the steps are the same.</p>

<p>There are many other situations that are very typical and can get an answer that will be useful to future visitors. For example the shadow acne artifact that was asked about recently. Any question that would make people think <em>""I've seen this before!""</em> probably falls into that category.</p>

<p>For more specific debug questions, especially the <em>""I want to do X but it doesn't work, here is my code""</em> kind, we can (and should) close as ""Off topic/Debug my code"". Those questions take a lot of work to answer, have little value for future visitors, and tend to make the community look inactive while they stay unanswered.</p>

3,"<p>I would add that in many cases the OP should be required to show an image of the problem if the error isn't sufficiently or easily explained (not for compile or runtime errors, but rather for graphical artifacts). There have been a few questions where the OP shares code and states that there's a problem, but the problem is either ambiguous or the code is difficult to run even if it's just a small self-contained snippet. I would guess that most people don't actually run the provided code, but just look at it and see if they can spot errors. The questions with provided images seem to have much higher response rates.</p>

3,"<p>OK, following the discussion I'm just going to say <em>mea culpa</em>. I was a little lazy and chose the easiest thing to do to get rid of a question that could not be made on-topic through edits. It seemed expedient and unproblematic at the time, but I should have considered the risk of pointing the questioner at other sites where the question would be equally off-topic.

3,"<p>I have come across a particular question from a new user and i, at first, wasn't sure what they were asking (hence my nonspecific answer). After giving it a few more reads it seems like they literally just want someone to implement some functionality in code and give it to them.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't migrate crap. If the question is low-quality, or would need substantial editing to be acceptable to the target site, then just close it.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't migrate unless you're sure the question is suitable for the target site. The ""migration rejected"" experience is pretty bad for questioners. If you are not a close-voter on the target site, check with them before migrating.</p></li>
<li><p>There's no point in migrating unless information would be lost. We'll chiefly migrate if there is good discussion in the comments or good answers, because those will be moved with the question. If there aren't, it's not often worth bothering unless the question is very high-effort.</p></li>

3,"<p>Due to the bumping of a lot of questions to the top of the main page, I've been looking at <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/history"">some of the recent edit reviewing going on</a>. A lot of edits are being approved that I would consider marginal.</p>

<p>Consider <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/5428"">this edit</a>. It consists solely of turning two HTTP addresses into two embedded links that use the destination page as the text. That's fine... I guess, but is that really something that should be approved? <em>Especially</em> since it's on a closed question to begin with. The maker of that edit seems to have a history of farming rep by making edits that consist primarily of changing HTTP addresses into links.</p>

<p>Indeed, looking at the last month or so of reviews, there have been almost no rejections. Reviewers basically just approve pretty much any change, no matter how tiny or inconsequential.</p>

3,"<p>The specific example does not look like an edit that should obviously be rejected. When/if the link breaks, the title of the page it used to point to will help in finding the new location of the material.  </p>

<p>So, it's plausible that reviewers indeed found the edit useful, and were not just clicking through. There is no ""too minor"" rejection reason, a reason for rejection is ""no improvement whatsoever"":</p>

3,"<p>Yes that's a difficult aspect of Q&amp;A I think. There is a wide spectrum between <em>""do this for me""</em> and genuine questions.</p>

<p>Originally this has been considered ""noise"" on StackOverflow, but this seems to have gone to some extremes (<a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/288160/no-thanks-damn-it"">see this discussion</a> or <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/290019/user-spamming-edits-removing-only-thanks"">this case</a>) and it has drawn a lot of criticism recently. I couldn't find a definite answer, but in the recent post on the official blog, they did recognize this problem:</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/""><em>Stack Overflow Isn’t Very Welcoming. It’s Time for That to Change.</em></a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Maybe it’s time we re-visited things like our “no pleases or thank yous’” rule. (It serves a valuable purpose by keeping signal high, but also suggests that we just might be Zuckerbots who aren’t even trying very hard to pass as actual humans).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>2. Assuming the edits are consistent with this Q&amp;A policies, are they still ok?</h1>

<p>Edits have a ""cost"", in the sense that as a user, seeing your own question or answer edited for little (or no) added value can be an annoyance. In turn, this affects how the entire Q&amp;A platform is perceived by users.</p>

<p>So where do we draw the line in sand, between rigidly enforcing guidelines and rules, and leaving posts as-is?</p>

3,"<p>I would tend to say:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's fine for the platform to indicate that a question or answer doesn't need salutations and other politeness forms;</li>
<li>But enforcing the absence of them is nonsensical.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the tools used by newcomers to approach a community they are not a part of. Removing them from their posts without notice while they are not familiar with the website yet sends a message that is confusing at best, and hostile at worst. If this happens on a question that has no useful answer yet, it also sends the signal that the community cares more about form and rules than content and helping.</p>

<p>Moreover, even assuming that we decide to edit salutations out, my personal opinion is that an edit needs an added value above a certain threshold to out-weight its cost. There are some people who are valuable to this community, and who might not know the rules well (because their expertise is CG, not SE). Such people may consider that they don't have time to play the ""respect the norm"" game and just walk away when such behavior happens.</p>

<p>For that reason, I don't think that small edits just for the sake of enforcing guidelines are worth it. Where I would draw the line, is readability and clarity. In that regard the examples in the links were perfectly understandable and readable without them, and those aspects were not improved by the edits.</p>

<p>In general I feel pretty strongly about small edits to enforce form. It has driven me away from another SE website where nearly every post was edited by one user, and I would prefer this behavior to not be encouraged over here.</p>

<p>P.S.: Additional food for thought:

3,"<p>It's New Year's Day in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_Time"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stack Exchange land</a>...</p>
<p>A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there certainly are <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">Moderators</a> here, a significant amount of the <em>moderation</em> is done by ordinary people, using the privileges
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.</p>
<p>As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together.
To that end, here is how the moderation done here on Computer Graphics breaks down by activity over the past 12 months:</p>

[closed]</a> which was closed as of-topic. It was not received well because it's not a question about an actual problem with a project that I've actually tried to implement. It's just preliminary research really.</p>

<p>But then I found that there's this site specifically for computer graphics. Great, I might just copy-paste that question over here. But first I just wanted to check that I don't misunderstand the ontopicness of this site also. So my question is, Is that question on-topic here?</p>

3,"<p>Ultimately that will be decided by the community, but after reading your question, it seems on-topic to me. It seems interesting to graphics practitioners and we definitely don't have the limitation here that questions have to be about code you're writing.</p>

<p>That said, if you do post it here (or ask for it to be migrated), I'd recommend adding the information that you want to write something similar yourself. You're more likely to receive answers helpful to you if answerers know the background and motivation of your question.</p>

3,"<p>This community hasn't had any new moderators since 2017 and has never had an election. Over the past few months, this site has lost members of its moderator team and we need to make sure that this site has moderators to meet your needs. Fortunately, this site is pretty quiet and moderator work isn't burdensome.</p>

<p>In general we want to keep a team of at least three moderators on any site. This makes sure that there's coverage in the case of people being on vacation or dealing with life while also giving them people to discuss issues with. We'd like an election to be successful so I'm posting this to try to assess the community members' willingness to step up and nominate themselves, when the actual election's nomination period starts.</p>

<p>Please leave an answer if you'd be willing to run for a moderator position, should we decide to run an election. Like I mentioned, we're looking at scheduling the nomination period to start some time in June '20.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is not an official election nomination thread, just a ""pulse check"" to get a notion of how many people here would be willing to step up, so you don't have to put up your whole election nomination.</p>

3,"<p>Every now and then, there appear some questions that are simply just off-topic for this site since they are not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions about math related to computer graphics,</li>
<li>Questions about a specific graphics programming or debugging problem,</li>
<li>Questions about a specific graphics API,</li>
<li>Questions about a specific graphics algorithm or concept.</li>
</ul>
<p>as specified by the <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">on-topic help page</a>.</p>
<p>The possible ways to flag or vote on such questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Questions asking us to recommend or find a book, tool, software, tutorial or other off-site resource are off-topic for Computer Graphics as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe your problem or need and the steps, if any, you've taken to solve it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Questions about creating artwork or using graphics software as an end-user are off-topic for this site. Consider if your question might be re-written to fit on Graphic Design. If your question is about Blender, it might fit on Blender.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This question belongs on another site in the Stack Exchange network</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other - add a comment</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first 2 options are too specific to cover all (the majority of?) possible off-topic questions. The third option is also kind of obsolete for <a href=""https://computergraphics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/268/why-can-off-topic-questions-only-be-migrated-to-meta"">some reasons</a>. So I have to use the fourth &quot;custom&quot; option. While I usually add a comment when raising a flag or casting a close vote anyways, I am still wondering why there is no &quot;Blatantly off-topic&quot; flag/vote like on other sites like StackOverflow and Game Development SE.
I see that there is no absolute need for this due to the &quot;custom comment&quot; option, however, I think it would be much more useful and frequently used than option 1-3.</p>

3,"<p>I'm not sure how much of an answer this will be but I will make an attempt. First, to me, &quot;blatantly&quot; off topic would be someone asking about gardening, plumbing or the like. I have yet to see this happen so I don't think it's a common problem.</p>
<p>Questions which are off topic but still somewhat related to computed graphics (eg. &quot;how do I increase the fps in [whatever game]&quot;) are probably best served with a non generic comment so the user gets at least some idea of why they are off topic. Otherwise, they risk asking same off topic question again under a slightly different form, as I think we've recently seen, and which likely prompted your question.</p>

3,"<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Computer Graphics Stack Exchange will begin the nomination stage for <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/election/1"">a special election</a> on <strong>August 17th</strong> to bring in two more moderators.</p>
<p>For full details of the process, see <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314459/experimenting-with-pro-tempore-elections"">the announcement on Meta Stack Exchange</a>. The timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Starting on August 17th, users can <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/election/1"">nominate themselves</a>. Users can also ask questions on meta for potential moderators to answer. (Use the <a href=""/questions/tagged/discussion"" class=""post-tag required-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;discussion&#39;"" rel=""tag"">discussion</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/election"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;election&#39;"" rel=""tag"">election</a> tags.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>On August 24th, if there are three or more candidates, we'll run an election. If not, I'll simply appoint the candidate/s. (There's a small chance we'll need to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/274114/lets-disallow-nominations-from-people-whove-been-suspended-in-the-past-year"">remove a nomination</a>, but I doubt that will come up.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If there is an election, we'll announce the results on meta on September 1st.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note for current moderators: there's no need to nominate yourself even though you'll likely get an email saying you should. The system assumes the first election is a graduation election, which would mean moderators would need to be re-elected. This isn't that sort of election.)</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the process, please stick them in an answer here.</p>

<p>Considering the responses to your previous <a href=""https://computergraphics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/298/2020-moderator-election-interest-check"">interest check for moderator election</a>, I am not sure if there will be any candidates nominating themselves.</p>
<p>However, I think we do need some new moderators here and maybe some candidates stay away from nominating themselves for some minor reasons like thinking there are better candidates or not being sure if they would be good moderators. So maybe we can use the <a href=""https://computergraphics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130/who-should-our-moderators-be"">procedure from the previous election</a> by also letting the community suggest candidates.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could just open a new question (or use this one) to name some users that we would like to see as candidates. Maybe this will encourage them to consider it.</p>
