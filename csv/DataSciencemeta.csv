7,"<p>One of the areas I am particularly interested in, is using systems like Lucene (ElasticSearch/Solr, etc.) to store data that is used for other computations.</p>

<p>Are questions about how to best index the data, structure the storage schemas, etc on topic?</p>

<p>For example, A question like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I use ElasticSearch, and I have a need to index multiple versions of data that are sourced from different places. Should I add a <code>source</code> field to the data and store it all in one large index, then filter by the source for most queries, or should I have multiple indexes, and then, only when I have queries that require multiple sources for the data should I aggregate the results over the plural indexes?</p>

<p>I can see that many ethical dilemmas will be related to INFOSEC or corporate espionage and data privacy.  While ethical questions could be pushed off to other sites, is there a place for those questions here?  Does the exploitation of big data create for us any professional responsibility?</p>

<p><strong>I would argue that we do have professional responsibilities</strong>, but many of those have to do with our concepts of <em>privacy</em>, <em>ownership</em> especially information ownership, and <em>public welfare</em>.  And since these concepts are highly dependent upon our cultural upbringing, I wanted to invite discussion on this topic to expose those things that myself and others may be taking for granted because of uncritical cultural biases.</p>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>The ethics of dealing with data, particularly data that is tied to specific, identifiable users, is an interesting and important topic.  But I would argue it's outside the scope of the site.  </p>

<p>I think the site should be focused on questions which professional data scientists are especially qualified to answer.  Data scientists might be more qualified to <em>pose</em> ethical questions relating to data (i.e., thinking of ways data could be used that might not occur to others), but I don't feel that this makes them any more qualified to <em>answer</em> such questions.  Moreover, I think that any such question could be presented in such a way that the potential ethical implications were clear to non-data scientists.  Given this, I think those questions ought to be asked on an ethics-focused site, not a data-science focused one.</p>

<p>It's not just a matter of keeping the focus of this site from getting too broad, but also of getting the best answers to those ethical questions.  With questions of ethics I think it's especially important to get a broader perspective, not limited to those working in a particular field.  Consider how the average government intelligence agent's perspective on the ethics of government surveillance might differ from that of a professional ethicist, or from the broader community, and whether it would really be better for the government agent to only be posing such questions to their peers in the agency.</p>

<p>Also, I think that keeping the site focused on data science theory and practice will keep it more in line with what people would likely expect the site to be about, and more consistent with the level of focus on other sites across the network.  A question like ""should physicists accept defense department funding, even if they don't approve of their government's military commitments overseas"" would probably be deemed off-topic on physics.stackexchange, and I would expect people to have a similar expectation here.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>The sites should attract somewhat different (but overlapping) user bases.  So part of the answer is, what sort of expertise is required to answer the question?</p>

<p>(2) If the best person to answer your question would be a professional software developer, ask on stackoverflow.</p>

<hr>

<p>To elaborate on what I mean by a question you would ask a statistician vs. a data scientist (and bearing in mind that some people could reasonably be called <em>both</em>):</p>

<h2>Suited For Cross-Validated but not Data Science</h2>

<p>Questions about a general statistical method or concept, either without reference to a particular practical application, or referencing a canned problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do I know whether I should pool variances when performing a two-sampled t-test?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the probability of drawing all the hearts from a randomly shuffled deck of cards before drawing any other suit?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do normal distributions occur so frequently in nature?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Suited For Cross-Validated and Data Science</h2>

<p>Questions about the application of statistical methods to real world problems, especially in problem areas commonly associated with data science (1).  Also, questions about specific algorithms used to approach these problems (not just general concepts):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What's a good method for grouping a list of trivia questions by topic?</p></li>
<li><p>How best to detect patterns in how the price of a commodity changes over time?</p></li>
<li><p>How best to choose the number of clusters for the k-means algorithm?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the advantages of logistic regression vs. SVM as an algorithm for classification?</p></li>
<li><p>Feature selection for ""final"" model when performing cross-validation in machine learning</p></li>

<h2>Suited For Data Science</h2>

<p>Questions about technologies and frameworks used by data scientists, such as those for managing and processing big data:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Which Big Data technology stack is most suitable for processing tweets, extracting/expanding URLs and pushing (only) new links into 3rd party system?</p></li>
<li><p>Horizontally scaling a distributed database, what should I use for a simple key-value store? Cassandra, HBase or Riak? what are the pros and cons?</p></li>
<li><p>How important is data locality to Hadoop and Map/Reduce?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(These were example questions offered in the Data Science definition phase)</p>

<h2>Suited for Data Science and Stack Overflow</h2>

<p>Questions about writing code to solve data science problems, and about the code underlying the technologies used by data scientists:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to implement a random forest algorithm in python?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the MapReduce sort algorithm work?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Suited for Stack Overflow but not Data Science</h2>

<p>Pure coding questions.  Questions dealing with programming languages (even if they're popular languages among the data science community) that aren't specific to any application of those languages for data science.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to sort a data frame by columns in R?</p></li>

<p>I'm sure there will be many questions that could also have been asked on either cross-validated or stackoverflow.  But I think there is value in cultivating a community specifically focused on data science, with a knowledge base that sits between those two disciplines.

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I would say, questions pertaining to programming languages and tools <em>as they are used in data science</em> are relevant.  Certainly I could ask a question about those tools that would be off topic, e.g. ""Why is Hadoop's logo an elephant?""</p>

The best site might depend on whether it's primarily a question about R as a programming language (stackoverflow), or primarily a question about statistical analysis using R as an example (crossvalidated), or primarily about R as a tool for data science (here).</p>

7,"<p>Since Robert Cartaino said we need specific examples, here's one.  In <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/22/k-means-clustering-for-mixed-numeric-and-categorical-data"">this answer</a>, I said:</p>

<blockquote>Huang's paper (linked above) also has a section on ""k-protoypes"" which applies to data with a mix of categorical and numeric features. It uses a distance measure which mixes the Hamming distance for categorical features and the Euclidean distance for numeric features.</blockquote>

<p>I would have liked to have actually included the equation for the distance measure [equation (9) from <a href=""http://www.cs.ust.hk/~qyang/Teaching/537/Papers/huang98extensions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the paper</a>], but without TeX it would have looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>d_2(X,Y) = Sum_{j=1...p}(x_j - y_j)^2 + gamma Sum_{j=p+1...m} delta(x_j, y_j)
</code></pre>

<p>which is pretty much unreadable.  Compare to the paper to see what it's supposed to look like.</p>

<hr>

<p>If I had wanted to be more detailed and include the cost function for k-prototypes (equation 10 in that same paper), it would be even more ridiculous:</p>

<pre><code>P(W, Q) = Sum_{l=1...k}(Sum_{i=1...n} w_{i,l} Sum_{j=1...p} (x_{i,j} - q_{l,j})^2 + gamma Sum_{i=1...n} w_{i,l} Sum_{j=p+1...m} delta(x_{i,j}, q_{l,j}))
</code></pre>

<p>Having multiple subscripts and summation over multiple indices is really pretty typical, because you can have indices representing your data points, indices representing the features of each data point, indices representing the range of values of your categorical features, and for clustering problems you have indices representing your clusters as well.  </p>

<p>But it's not just clustering problems;  any kind of problem which is expressible in terms of vectors in a multidimensional vector space (which includes a great many data science problems) is going to be quite a bit harder to describe without access to something like TeX.</p>

<p><strong>It’s important to rally when we open the floodgates.</strong> The amount of activity and engagement we’ve seen in the first few weeks has been somewhat low. Increasing content while keeping quality high will be key. <em>I urge you to think about how to really evangelize the site when you move to public beta.</em> Discussing the <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/"">7 Essential Meta Questions</a> and <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/"">voting early and often</a> will be important too.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, the change will take place next week, so you have a little time to think and prepare.</p>

<p>And again, congrats! </p>

7,"<p>I was a part of the Big Data beta about a year ago and I was saddened when it <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/40518?phase=beta"">didn't meet the qualifications to get out of Beta</a>.</p>

<p>A few notes from the link above:</p>

<ol>
<li>We need to average at least 15 questions a day.</li>
<li>We need to average 90% answered questions.</li>
<li>Hand out votes like they are candy.  We should have 150 users with 200+ reputation, 10 users with 2,000 reputation, and 5 users with 3,000 reputation.  This is an area where we failed heavily on the big data beta.</li>
<li>Answer questions that have already been answered.  There should be 3 answers for every question, not just the one correct one.</li>
<li>Keep coming back and encourage all of your friends to keep coming back.  We should have 1500 visits per day.  With Big Data we only managed 60/day.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a couple of checkpoints where Stack Exchange will pop in and decide whether or not to keep the beta going.  I had originally thought we had 30 days to get things going, but we were shut down after 18 days.  I've seen another beta shut down after just a few days, although I can't remember the name.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I like this question because 'Data Science' is such a ambiguous phrase, and I'm intensely curious about others in this role.</p>

<p>During my graduate studies in applied math, I realized academia wasn't for me.  I finished and looked for interesting roles in the industry.  I realized I couldn't do anything productive without learning programming languages, so I spent the following year learning as much R and Python as I could.  With a background in machine learning, I fell into this 'data science role'.  Most of the time, I feel the classic 'imposter syndrome', where I'm in a data science position with a large company and feel I'm flying by the seat of my pants most of the time.  I'm beginning to realize that maybe 'data science' is supposed to be like that and there is no cure-all methodology for problems.  I've always been a sort of 'jack-of-all-trades' (master of none), or at least I like to think so, and my work let's me do exactly that.  My work is 90% data acquisition and cleanup, 9% meetings/report making, and 1% writing statistical/machine learning/text mining code. I enjoy what I do, and like to think it makes a difference.</p>

<p>I've fell in love with stack overflow since I've started learning R/Python, and can't wait to contribute/use this new resource!</p>

7,"<p>I am a post graduate in computer science and have been working with cloud computing for past few years. I have mainly worked with OpenStack and some virtualization tools like KVM, vagrant etc.</p>

<p>Few weeks ago, I attended a conference on Big data and there was a presentation about role of data scientists. That fascinated me. Since then I have been following every Big data related resource to help myself to learn this new field. </p>

<p>I got there through a reddit post and hope to engage in some useful conversation. </p>

7,"<p>I'm new, but my mindset is that if it's related even a little bit, during the beta you should ask it and you shouldn't be discouraged.</p>

<p>3 weeks into the beta and there are only 70 questions on the board.  There's no reason to avoid asking anything at this point.</p>

  <p>I was a part of the Big Data beta about a year ago and I was saddened when it didn't meet the qualifications to get out of Beta.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been a part of 7+ betas so far of which a few were closed. It is always disappointing to see that happen. However, the decision to close a site that is a ghost town is much better than keeping it open and causing frustration to any people who may come across it in the future. </p>

<p>One other thing that I came to understand is that every beta is different. The metrics are variable, and are not applied as-is to every site. Various considerations such as engagement, moderation, commenting, and quality come into the picture; none of which can be easily given a number.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to average at least 15 questions a day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the beta, it is more important to create 4-5 good researched specific questions per day; than 15 mediocre ones. For the first few months, quality is paramount as it sets the tone for the site for the months to come. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to average 90% answered questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another parameter that varies depending on the community. In some cases, it is simply not possible to maintain very high ratios as experts of certain niches within a field may not be present. This doesn't seem to be a problem here; the current percentage of answered questions is 100%.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep coming back and encourage all of your friends to keep coming back. We should have 1500 visits per day. With Big Data we only managed 60/day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is something that requires attention and directed efforts to increase. The visit/day is very low. It deserves a separate post, though.</p>

<p>The policy for the past year has been to have 1-2 week long private betas, after which the site is closed or made public. This site got an extended private beta and is one of the first this year to have that. The 30 day beta period has not been the policy for over a year now.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>No. Career advice questions are a problematic area that is extremely opinion oriented, specific to an individual, and in some ways fairly broad depending on how the question is put across. These questions are never good for a site, moreover, the same career question can be repeated 10s of times with minor modifications making every of them seem unique, even though it may all boil down to the same set of facts or opinions.</p>

<p>Career advice should be explicitly off-topic. </p>

<p>All three focus on the same thing; how to get started as a data scientist. </p>

<hr>

<p>Also, I am not saying that these questions cannot work at all. I am saying that they have not worked in the past; but it is entirely possible that it may be possible to make them work given certain constraints and guidelines. However,  without and until any suggestions or discussion in this direction, I think they should be closed to maintain quality and focus of the site.</p>

7,"<p>Approximately 25 years ago, one of my friends bought me an already-old <a href=""http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=629"" rel=""nofollow"">Ice Felix HC85</a>. Three weeks later I finally came out of my room and showed to my father my first program, a chess interface which was able to move pieces only. I felt trapped and free at the same time. </p>

<p>I had enough luck to often put myself in situations for which I was not prepared. I have a deep respect for well-done science in general, and I spent the rest of my life learning, marveling at the math, computer science, physics pearls. </p>

<p>Three years ago I participated at a machine learning contest, knowing nothing about statistics, machine learning and so. I was trying to find an answer to the question: ""What an experienced programmer can do in this field without apriori knowledge?"". I did well, but the most important fact is that the contest was held for an year, and I spent that year thinking on how to find the truth when it is covered with noise? </p>

<p>After the contest was done I knew that I will do that for the rest of my life and I started to learn statistics and machine learning properly. I decided also to write for myself the best set of tools, because the only way I know in order to learn is the hard way. I am far away, but that does not hurt me, because there are a lot of good things to do, a lot of good problems to solve and an infinity of wonders to start my mind at. And now, I am right here.</p>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I've been here...  less than a week.  I see more discussion about what shouldn't pop than I see questions on the site.  </p>

<p>One of the most popular questions on StackOverflow is against the rules - ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list"">The Definitive C++ Book Guide and List</a>""</p>

<p>If those questions are closed, that wipes out 50% of the activity on the site since I've been here.  </p>

<p>My opinion is that if you want to close a question, be prepared to post 2 other questions that will garner participation.  Stick to the rulebook when there's actually activity to moderate.  Bugging a handful of active users and telling them what they can and can't say is just going to chase them away.  The point of being here isn't to get moderation experience.  It's to share and pick up knowledge in the arena of data science.</p>

<p>At this point an argument about whether R or Python is better (if anyone actually cared) would at least draw some lurkers into participation and maybe inspire some good questions.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p><strong>Yes</strong>, I think so, and this site is probably the best one for such questions.</p>

<p>I tend to focus on operational aspects of analytics in work as a ""data scientist"" -- data cleaning, fusion, large-scale model building, serving, productionization. However I find the popular understanding of ""data scientist"" refers more to exploratory/investigative analytics -- querying data, building ad-hoc models, and most certainly visualizing data.</p>

<p>A common path I see organizations take through ""data science"" is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collect and store data</li>
<li>Query data</li>
<li>Visualize data</li>
<li>Model data</li>
<li>Operationalize modeling</li>
</ul>

<p>In most contexts, the path includes a BI tool like Tableau or Qlikview, connected to the data store. It's often a more basic, useful and prevalent discipline than modeling.</p>

<p>So yes I think this site should welcome well-formed questions on visualization.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I am more of a self taught technical hustler.  I prefer to work in Clojure, but I am dangerous in Python, Javascript, and SAS.  I am also data scientist, 7 years in with experience running the gamut.

<p>Currently, I am lead data scientist at a startup, and I enjoy taking on a lot of side projects on top of that.</p>

<p>What interests me in data science is the ability to exercise my curiosity muscle.  My data science journey can be traced back to a book I read in high school: ""How to Lie with Statistics"", and one early on in my career: ""The Black Swan"".  Each was an eye opening experience that only propelled me further down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>But I thought it might be totally out of topic based on the other sets of questions I saw in the main board. Is okay to post questions about specific implementations of a IR algorithm, for example, and asking for guidance in making they perform better?</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>A question about code performance might not be specific to machine learning or data science, and so might be best suited to StackOverflow. But if the question's answer likely involves tuning or modifying the algorithm, I think it's a good fit for the specialist crowd here. I guess it depends on whether you think it's a matter of tuning code or algorithm.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Regrading the language comparison questions, I strongly believe that question asking for comparison of programming languages (mainly Python vs R in this site) are opinion-based and not based on real factor-based comparison and are not comprehensive. In fact, there may be a lot of specific use cases in which a language can be better than another, but the answers do not cover these aspects, so they will be misleading instead of providing good guidance.</p>

<p>Additionally, such questions occur over and over, which results in a bunch of questions essentially discussing the same thing, for example, compare these two questions which seems different at first, but have a same set of answers (comparing RAM usage of R and Python over and over!):</p>

<ul>

analysis</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/41/227"">Is the R language suitable for Big Data</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So I think to favor quality over quantity, all programming language comparison questions must be closed as being opinion based, or at least just have on such question (like: What is the best programming language for data science) and limit all discussion to that single question and close all others, existing or new.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> As we all know, Python is by far the best language for data science, so why bother asking programming language comparison questions knowing that? :)</p>

So, the idea is simply to either comment link-only answers, in order to ask the OP to improve their question, or simply suggest an edit.</p>

<p>Now, to leave a question here: what should actually be done for link-only answers? Are these suggestions enough/reasonable, or should we flag them anyway? Any further suggestions are surely much welcome.</p>

  <p>I think we should rather strive to comment/edit the posts, so as to make them <strong>not</strong> link-only answers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's every user's prerogative to decide which of the following tools to use, when they find an answer (or question) that they think is in some way deficient:</p>

<ul>
<li>Downvoting</li>
<li>Flagging</li>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Commenting</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if the answer is truly link-only, then <em>it has no original content for you to edit</em>, and I would <em>strongly</em> discourage editing over the other three options. Edits should not be used to change the meaning of someone else's answer, according to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/editing"">the guidelines provided in the help center</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes the linked content contains a brief excerpt that you can copy into the answer, which changes it from a bare link (bad) to a direct quote with a reference link (not as bad). In that case, an edit might be worthwhile and appropriate, provided you <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/referencing"">don't copy and paste the whole of the linked content</a>.</p>

<p>However, if you're <strong>producing original content where there is none</strong>, you should do so in a <strong>separate answer</strong>. </p>

<hr>

<p>If you don't feel a separate answer is justified, or you're for some reason unwilling/unable to write one, your alternatives are to <strong>comment, downvote, or flag</strong>. In my opinion, commenting is the worst of these options when dealing with link-only answers, for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lazy users tend to respond poorly (if at all) to criticism.</li>
<li>Comments about post quality clutter up the page for those users who are only there to discuss or read about the question and its answer(s).</li>
<li>When your comment doesn't lead to an improvement, it can end up drawing attention to a low-quality answer.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to downvoting over commenting - it's still negative reinforcement, but at least you're not inviting debate or increasing the visibility of the answer. That being said, the absolute best option is to flag the link-only answer. This is the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/225370/254929"">general policy for the entire StackExchange network</a> (not just StackOverflow):</p>

7,"<p>I'm posting this to discuss whether questions about performance optimizations are off-topic in data science, and of course to see better definitions for such questions. My main relation with data science -- which I'm not sure if it does actually exist right now -- is via performance improvement/distributed computing. Some of the questions I've posted, which I consider to be related to performance optimizations, are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/451/how-to-speedup-message-passing-between-computing-nodes"">How to speedup message passing between computing nodes</a>;</li>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>@TimGoodman makes a strong argument; I'm going to try to present a counter-argument.</p>

<p>Tim raises the question: <strong>""Are data scientists especially qualified to answer ethical questions relating to data?""</strong> I think we agree that the answer is no, not necessarily; but is that really an appropriate metric for whether such questions are on-topic?</p>

<p>Professional data scientists are <em>more likely to have experience and training</em> relevant to certain ethical questions surrounding data. Because it's a somewhat interdisciplinary field, many of these questions <em>are</em> more appropriate for a different site on the network, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethical questions about storing data --> security.SE or DBA.SE</li>
<li>Ethical questions about sourcing data --> opendata.SE</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, we can reasonably expect that there are ethical questions intimately related to that intersection of fields where data scientists live. We shouldn't <em>a priori</em> dismiss such questions as outside the scope of a community explicitly intended for those who have a personal or professional interest in just such a discussion, on the basis that not every data scientist is also an ethicist.</p>

<p><strong>I would argue that the best answers to such questions are more likely to be informed by professional experience in the field of data science than by any other experience.</strong></p>

<p>Every profession that involves interaction with customers or the public demands that its members spend some time during their careers thinking about ethics. Professional organizations have ethical standards and perform ethical inquiries; certification and licensure exams include ethical questions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, how many people with careers unrelated to the field of data science are obligated to spend time ""exercising their data science muscle?"" It may be that the best answers to these questions will come from someone who is both an ethicist and a data scientist, but we're probably more likely to find that person here than on a general ethics site.</p>

<p>In fact, there <em>is</em> no ethics site in the SE network - ethics questions currently belong to philosophy.SE. I don't think it's debatable that the proportion of users who have at least some understanding of both data science <em>and</em> ethics and a desire to discuss these questions is much higher here than it will ever be on philosophy.SE. Perhaps at such time as there is a professional ethics site in the network, we could revisit this question, but for now I think it's in our best interest to <strong>treat ethics questions as on-topic, but migrate them to closely related sites like opendata.SE or security.SE on a case-by-case basis</strong>.</p>

7,"<p>Of the three examples you give, only the second one (""How can I best clean data set D?"") clearly falls within the scope of this site, because it's really about data manipulation.</p>

<p>Questions <strong>soliciting recommendations for or links to to data sets are off-topic</strong>, not only because there's no data science involved in merely locating a data set, but also by virtue of being <a href=""https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/data-request"">perfect questions to ask on a related network site</a>.</p>

<p>Since Open Data is still in the beta phase, this could conceivably change. Migrating questions back and forth between beta sites is something that typically isn't going to happen for reasons discussed in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/92993/254929"">FAQ: Migrations</a> (and more generally, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/10249/254929"">What is migration and how does it work?</a>).</p>

<p>For the time being, it's in our best interest to support both sites in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Educate users about the scope of this site and the existence of other sites with complementary scope. In other words, <strong>comment aggressively</strong> and <strong>provide relevant links</strong> to meta discussions and/or network sites. Don't just tell them they're on the wrong site - tell them where to go and how to get there (""this question is off topic here, but it would be perfect for <a href=""http://opendata.stackexchange.com"">Open Data</a>"").</li>
<li>Discourage users from <em>asking</em> out-of-scope questions by <strong>flagging to close</strong> questions that exist primarily to request data set links and recommendations. And whenever you flag, <strong>comment</strong>! Closed questions <strong>can be reopened if our scope changes</strong>.</li>
<li>Discourage users from <em>answering</em> out-of-scope questions by <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/194963/254929""><strong>downvoting the answers</strong></a>. I know this is a bit controversial while we are in beta; many users are of the opinion that we should hand upvotes out like candy just to pad our stats, thinking ""this helps to keep the site going"" - but consider that <em>the folks making that decision are neither blind nor stupid</em>. There are plenty of ways to generate page views and build community without sacrificing quality.</li>

<p>Soon after, I found <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/497/322"">a question asking about longitudinal data</a>, and found that we also have a <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/time-series"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;time-series&#39;"" rel=""tag"">time-series</a> tag in use.</p>

<p>These are related terms, but there's not much consensus about <em>how</em> related; you get different answers from different contexts. (Here's an <a href=""http://spssx-discussion.1045642.n5.nabble.com/Re-Difference-Between-Longitudinal-Data-and-Panel-Data-td1077897.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>.) </p>

<p>There <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/66491"">doesn't seem to be much interest</a> in strictly defining these terms on Cross Validated (and I don't think we could even if we wanted to) -- but how do we want to categorize these questions?</p>

<ul>
<li>Should we have tags for <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/panel-data"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;panel-data&#39;"" rel=""tag"">panel-data</a> and <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/longitudinal-data"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;longitudinal-data&#39;"" rel=""tag"">longitudinal-data</a>? </li>

<li>Should we make some or all of these into tag synonyms?</li>
</ul>

<p>(For what it's worth, I tend to think of ""time series"" as being specific to 2D cases where the dependent variable is the date or time an observation was made and use ""panel"" and ""longitudinal"" interchangeably to refer to the more general case with many dimensions.)</p>

7,"<p>Data science is a cross disciplinary field. Questions about application of statistical methods for various real life datasets processing should be on topics.</p>

<p>The questions that are given as examples here have very little connection with applied aspect of statistical analysis for real life datasets.

<p>I am the author of the first question above and my question was a very real situation I have to deal with in my company. Of course I could ask it in CV, however, I believe that it would be of interest for the members of this site. Probably the same opinion had the at least 5 people that upvoted it, the 2 people that answered it and the 14 people that upvoted  their answers (duplicates included).</p>

<p>Similar scenario for question on p-values. The big-data concept and all the implications on statistics are something that statisticians are only very recently start to have to deal with (and history will show how ready they are to change mindsets - so many fields have originated in stats and quickly became independent because classic statisticians were not able to follow or adapt). </p>

If the performance issue is not caused by large amounts of data probably it is off-topic.</p>

<h1><a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/528/322"">https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/528/322</a></h1>

<p>This question comes from a new user without much participation in the beta so far. It's not a perfect question in every way, but I think it has two qualities that make it excellent for DataScience.SE:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Immediately identifies a <strong>specific scope that is broadly relevant</strong>. Polling data is an area of much analytical interest, but the OP right away tells us to consider the case where there are <em>more than two candidates</em> and a <em>small number of data points</em>. Questions that identify this type of scope have the wonderful quality of of being interesting and relevant while still being <em>answerable</em> in the way that SE questions should be.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggests a <strong>complete approach</strong> to tackling the problem. Some questions come in the form, ""I have done A, B and C. What do I do next?"" That often leads to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/122986/254929"">grouchy comments</a> and users talking about their favorite software. In this question, the OP tells us their goal and describes their plan, in terms of a recognizable algorithm and an established model. It gives other users something focused and concrete to respond to, independent of the details of implementation.</p></li>

It would be much easier to maintain one standard, built-in resource for creating equations such as these.</p>

<p>In particular, these equations do not lend themselves to regular text formatting, because of the lengths of the numerators and denominators, and the use of multiple-character subscripts.</p>

7,"<p>The cliché holds that we are drowning in data, yet starving for knowledge.  Wikipedia characterises <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science"">data science</a> as <em>the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data</em>, and it defines <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"">statistics</a> as <em>the study of the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data</em>.  These two seem very similar to me.  What characterises the difference between data science and statistics?  Is one a subset of the other?</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>My personal impression is that a pure (old-school) statistician would usually live in an R (or SAS) world; they are rather unlikely to be running Hadoop jobs on EMR.  The scale of the data is one difference, the type of tools is another, and a third difference is close ties to various complex/irregular/rich/high volume/high velocity sources of data like IoT sensors or machine vision or web clickstreams.</p>

<p>Some of the very early sources on data science talk about this:</p>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Although including statistics, data science lies at the intersection of programming, statistical modeling, and social science (or other substantive) knowledge.</p>

<p>Special problems for data scientists include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Data collection</strong>: web scraping and online surveys</li>
<li><strong>Data manipulation</strong>: recoding messy data and extracting meaning from linguistic and social network data</li>
<li><strong>Data scale</strong>: working with extremely large data sets</li>
<li><strong>Data mining</strong>: finding patterns in large, complex data sets, with an emphasis on algorithmic techniques</li>
<li><strong>Data communication</strong>: helping turn ""machine-readable"" data into ""human-readable"" information via visualization</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, although incorporating many of the techniques of statistics (such as regression modeling), data science can be viewed as a more general field, with an emphasis on practical applications, communicating results to a wide audience, and using algorithmic models.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Also note that statistics has traditionally focused on inference from a sample to a population, while data scientists today typically have a full population or a sample so large that the traditional tools of statistical inference break down (e.g., small p-values are plentiful in a data of several million individuals!). Furthermore, statistics has traditionally under-emphasized algorithmic models (e.g., k-means clustering, neural nets, random forests), data visualization (e.g., Tufte is actually a Ph.D. in political science!), natural language processing (cf. computational linguists), and the difficulties of cleaning messy data.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Statistics is very powerful tool in the field of data science, but as the question put it, <em>we are drowning in data</em>. The one aspect of datascience not included in statistics is initial data exploration. The methods used to initially inspect very large datasets, which the investigator may have no idea of, are not part of statistics literature. An example of this could be the selection of an algorithm to plot network related data; force-directed or spring, or a mixed approach. If someone is dealing with large scale community detection you need to choose a proper tool such as the Louvain algorithm or walk trap. These are not covered in conventional statistics.</p>

<p>As well a datascientist must be aware of computational challenges with large datasets where even addition can be a difficult task. </p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Similar to those applied-statistics cases that are doing factor analysis, I think that as data scientists, we are frequently engaged in making epistemological judgments.  That is, what sorts of things can our data sets tell us (what inferences can be made)?  And which types of correlational relationships warrant further investigation as putative causal factors.</p>

<p>Statistics, taken solely as a mathematical endeavor, is quite clearly deductive and <em>a priori</em> in its search for knowledge.</p>

<p>Data science can't really ever be divorced from culture and perspective, and is a meaningful pursuit within certain kinds of contexts to answer certain kinds of questions (or to ask new ones?).  <strong>Data science, as I see it, has its value because of the practitioners' empirical-embededness.</strong></p>

<p>With the burgeoning issues created by big data, a data scientist separates the cream from the spoiled milk (by analogy).  The result is that we not only assist in answering questions, but we have a sort of rootedness in our experiences that enables us to undertake informed data-collection.  We find and create meaning with the specifically chosen tools of our respective trades.</p>

7,"<p>I think it's most important to get an option for <strong>migration to Cross Validated/stats.SE</strong>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of examples (<a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/q/71/322"">some linked here</a>) of questions that at least some of the community thinks should be moved to Cross Validated, and <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/105071"">one instance</a> I know of where the migration has already occurred. There are <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/92997/254929"">reasons to avoid migrating to beta sites</a> but I have yet to find a source suggesting migration to <em>established</em> sites is discouraged.</p>

<hr>

<p>I think we should have an option for <strong>migration to OpenData.SE</strong>.</p>

<p>We have seen several questions that are <em>perfect</em> examples of the type of request that OpenData.SE <em>exists to fulfill</em>, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/587/322"">Where can I download historical market capitalization and daily turnover data for stocks?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/422/322"">Publicly available social network datasets/APIs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The only caveat here is that OpenData.SE has been <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/51674/open-data"">in beta for over a year with very low daily questions and views</a>. If there is reason to believe they may not leave beta, it might be prudent to wait and see before migrating new ""data request"" questions to them. </p>

<p>On the other hand, clearly they need the questions; I would argue that by failing to migrate questions that obviously belong there, we're making life harder for them and being ""poor neighbors."" I think they've been around long enough that we should consider them to be relatively established, and send them questions that will improve their site while focusing ours on <em>data science</em> rather than <em>data chatter</em>.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I think the tag is appropriate when scale is a non-trivial part of the problem. Not all data science involves huge amounts of data. While I agree that ""big data"" is an ill-defined term, I think it is relatively unambiguous here as a tag for questions where the challenge is partly data volume.</p>

<p>Whether a given question really has anything to do with scale issues is another issue. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt in general. Someone who tags a question this way ought to set out the problem of data size but this is just a way of flagging it as scale-related.</p>

<p>Here I think the question is related to data size although it's not obvious. The fact that retraining the simple model is identified as a significant obstacle suggests scale is a problem.</p>

I am a somewhat regular user on SO and Programmers.SE.  By that I mean that I have some experience using this kind of sites, and I know a bit about their policies &mdash; however, I do not know much about the particular policies of this site.</p>

<p>I find it quite surprising that code highlighting (a.k.a syntax highlighting) is not enabled on this site.  I would expect code snippets in R, Python, Scala and (possibly) Java to be required fairly regularly to answer questions, or to ask questions at all.</p>

You can read <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/10249/254929"">What is migration and how does it work?</a> for a thorough discussion but the relevant bit is quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Avoid migrating answered questions.</strong> The point of migration is to send the question to an on-topic place when it can get answered. If    the OP already has an answer, then we've already defeated the purpose    of migration and the destination site won't have anything to do with    the question. Avoid migrating these questions unless they are of    extremely good quality and risk deletion on the current site.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Don't migrate for the sake of migration.</strong> We only migrate questions because they are off-topic on this site. It is perfectly    possible for a question to be on-topic on multiple sites, but that is    not a reason to migrate it elsewhere. The OP asked their question    here, so if it's on-topic here, then it should stay here.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Stack Overflow also has a tag for NLP and while they might prefer to stick with the more technical implementation questions, that distinction isn't always clear, so it seems reasonable to leave this question where it was asked.

<p>My take: as in the thread linked above, statistics are a part of data science... together with hacking skills and domain expertise. I believe that specific questions about statistics that do not connect with non-statistical data mining or software or domain specifics would be better at CrossValidated, for two reasons:</p>

<li><p>Answered statistics questions may be helpful for other people in the future. But those people will look for answers to their stats questions on CrossValidated, not here.</p></li>

<p>Here's <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/180335/254929"">another relevant discussion on meta.SE</a> that provides a counter opinion, at least to some degree. As Rachel notes, canonical list questions do exist on some sites - but in looking for examples, I haven't yet found any of <em>third party resources</em> except for <a href=""https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/639"">one FAQ post on meta.hermeneutics</a>.</p>

<p>Personally, I think tag wikis are the <em>most appropriate</em> place to collect third-party links and resources -- it says ""wiki"" right in the name, after all. Tag wikis are designed to hold useful information and aren't held to the same standards as Q&amp;A on either main or meta sites. But there are a few obstacles to that approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>What tag do you put it in? If it's a coherent set of resources, it should be stored in a central location. (In our case this isn't that big a problem since we have an <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/education"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;education&#39;"" rel=""tag"">education</a> tag already in use that could serve this purpose.)</li>
<li>It's generally accepted that very few users ever read tag wikis -- and there's no great way around this except to refer to the resource as frequently as you can justify in the course of other posts and comments.</li>
<li>Users need a lot more reputation to freely edit tag wikis than they would need to edit a community wiki answer.</li>
<li>Maintenance and outreach are <em>a ton of work</em>. This is an obstacle for any approach to collecting a list of resources. You need a core group that's willing to keep links working, add new resources as they become available and update/remove old ones as they change or disappear.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're really committed to making this work, I would advise you to start building your resource list in the <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/education"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;education&#39;"" rel=""tag"">education</a> tag wiki, and use this meta discussion (or a fresh one) as a place to organize your efforts. There is a long tradition of organizing things like retagging and queue-reduction efforts on meta, so such a post would be legitimate, and also give you an idea of whether this community is ready to take on the effort you're suggesting (remember, it's going to also put demands on reviewers to approve the suggested wiki edits) at this point in the public beta.</p>

<li>It's double-wiki and under <strong>collaborative lock</strong> to make sure that the greatest number of users are able to pitch in without creating a mess of competing answers.</li>
<li>It has been contributed to (and heavily reorganized) by community moderators and some of the highest-rep users on SO, all of whom have greatly expanded moderation tools at their disposal.</li>
<li>Despite the continued effort to maintain that particular question, it was created a long time ago. This was a very different site in 2008 and much of what was good practice then is now effectively <em>verboten</em>.</li>

<p>I still think it's a good idea to create this kind of resource in our tag wikis. That being said, it's a massive undertaking for a feature that can <em>support</em> a healthy site but which is not a <em>substitute</em> for core content (questions and answers). We have only three non-moderator users who can approve tag wiki edits and our main challenge right now is to grow our community and expand our core content. So in my opinion, it would be best to table any <em>major</em> effort for now, and revisit this idea when the beta picks up steam.</p>

<p>Unless we get a much larger and more active community going, this site will die in beta, just like <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/57719/artificial-intelligence"">enter link description here</a> did.</p>

<p>I must admit that I don't see a future for this site. It is too redundant, and I am not a big fan of having another SE site for every topic. I see too much overlap with stats.stackexchange.com; and I've seen too many questions being cross-posted to three or more sites. That does not make sense to me.</p>

<p>If you're really interested in this site, fill it with life!</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I have no idea how this can be solved, for sure this site has lost its momentum.</p>

<p>However, I can tell you why I personally decided to leave this site. Personal opinion but it's time to express it. I was very active and excited when it was first lunched but I didn't want to invest time and effort to a site that from early on it was obvious it will end up to the described situation.</p>

<p>The first reason is simple: people without enough experience don't get what is different about the (overloaded) term data science compared to programming or statistics. Or between DS.se compared to SO or CV. The difference is not on the topics covered by the questions asked. It is about how the engineering and stats should work together when you need to build a solution to a problem. For example, when I ask the question ""How can I measure the mean value?"" I expect an answer with a simple formula in CV, or the description of a simple algorithm in SO. In DS I would expect to see an answer on how this can be solved efficiently in a Hadoop cluster, or how it can be estimated in sub-linear time by sampling and so on... I expect answers typically not found or discussed in either CV or SO. Nevertheless, people in here were ready to flag questions off-topic based on the keywords used.</p>

<p>This is a simplified example, but I hope you get the point. If you don't get the point then this lead us to the second reason... The quality of the questions AND the answers was very low (I stopped checking at all the last few months, I assume  it didn't get much better). This is because questions were asked from software eng. that want to become data scientists. So yes, their questions would get good answers in CV. Also, I have seen few good questions that are answered again by people who don't get the difference between DS/SO/CV leading to naif/low quality answers.</p>

<p>The above are my personal opinion and if you disagree, I am sorry but I don't have the energy or time to change your mind (so don't expect me to answer back). However, I would be really happy to hear what you think is the answer to this question. </p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I don't think redundancy has been the problem at all. We all knew about the overlap from the start and I agree with <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/a/113/322"">iliasfl's point</a> that users should be able to expect very different types of answers when asking a question that's on-topic on multiple sites, depending on where they choose to ask. The root of the problem in my view is that too many questions like these are being treated as appropriate/acceptable content:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/1151/322"">Prerequisites for Data Science</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/41/322"">Is the R language suitable for Big Data</a></li>

<li><a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/793/322"">Uses of NoSQL database in data science</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not saying every one of these questions should clearly be closed or that any of them necessarily deserve downvotes, but <em>questions like these</em> at some point came to represent a major portion of the site's content. I used to come read through the new questions here every day (when I had more free time) and I definitely started to feel like the noise was overwhelming the signal. That's <em>really bad</em> for a site that has yet to establish itself; it's a strong disincentive for attracting and retaining expert users at a time when building a strong user base is most critical.</p>

<p>It's not the <em>naiveté</em>  of these questions that makes them bad content – beginners are perfectly capable of asking thought-provoking, well-researched, non-trivial questions. For that matter, even a <em>trivial</em> question can make for good content, provided it's well-defined and difficult to answer through secondary research (or the answer is simply not available online).</p>

<p>The main problem with these questions is that they don't fit the format of the network, which isn't something to be taken lightly. The Q&amp;A format of Stack Exchange is a purposeful and central part of its design that has evolved over the years to better support that ""repository of useful and accurate answers"" mission. We discourage questions like the above – primarily by closing them – because <em>they hurt that mission</em>. To quote from Jeff's blog entry, <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/optimizing-for-pearls-not-sand/"">Optimizing For Pearls, Not Sand</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s true that you can’t have Q&amp;A without <em>questions</em>, but having the
  wrong sorts of questions is far more dangerous. The fastest way to
  kill any Q&amp;A site is to flood it with low-quality questions....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, in our case it's not that we're being flooded with terrible, awful, no-good, very bad questions. These aren't questions nobody should ever ask, anywhere; they're questions that are of <em>practically no interest</em> to the community of experts that we need to attract in order to generate <em>other</em> high-quality content that in turn attracts <em>better</em> questions and <strong>builds and retains momentum for a young site</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the major flaw with the position that some have held throughout this beta that since we lack content, we should be less choosy about what content is acceptable. Actually, I think the opposite is true in a beta – the less content we have, the less signal we have, and the more important it is to weed out the noise. It's only by being choosy and scoping the site <em>with the ultimate goals in mind</em> that we send the message to the expert community: <em>Stick around because this place is growing into something worthwhile.</em></p>

<p>This is closely related to the conclusion of the aforementioned blog post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Answers are the real unit of work in any Q&amp;A system. Therefore, the
  only logical thing to do is to <strong>maximize the happiness and enjoyment of
  answerers</strong>. If this means aggressively downvoting or closing unworthy
  and uninteresting questions, so be it. Without a community of people
  willing to <em>answer</em> questions, it really doesn’t matter if there are
  questions at all, does it?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>As to whether the site is ""dying""... I think it would be a mistake to think that any beta is <em>easy</em>, if only we have the right policies or cast the right votes. But it may be that DataScience.SE is a particularly hard site to build, at least at the present time. The field itself is very interdisciplinary and very young; how many people really think of themselves as data science experts? Or think of their problems specifically as data science problems? I very much believe this site can and should exist, but the evidence seems to indicate that it's not practical in this incarnation at this time.</p>

<p>While it sounds like words' play, I think that in this case the <strong>emphasis</strong> of each field is represented directly by the respective <em>adjective</em>.

7,"<p>I'm a BI Developer in the energy industry, and I'm doing an MSc in Computing while I work. My most immediate (and pressing) link to data science is that I'm doing my dissertation on data mining in a set of energy data. It's been a lot to learn given my background (English degree, followed by several years working in application support and development, followed by a year in BI, while doing a Computing MSc which doesn't touch data mining or machine learning topics). I found this site while looking for answers to questions I had about how to carry out some of my dissertation work.</p>

<p>The dissertation won't be the end if my involvement in data science, though; it's been the realisation of a long-term desire to work with data in this way. There are a number of things which I now realise all rest within data science which I'd always been intrigued by, and I suspect that if I were younger and going through school now, I'd probably be aiming myself at a related degree. My hope is to continue some of the things I'm working on for my dissertation in my workplace, and thus continue significant learning in the field of data science. As I find this stuff fun, I'll probably be doing it in my own time as well, on other data sets!</p>

<p>Areas I'm especially interested in at the moment (some very much influenced by my dissertation or available work data sets) include time series analysis, forecasting, useful Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, iPython, etc.), and data visualisation.

<p>I enjoy checking this site a few times a day and participating in discussions. Frequently, I find myself flagging posts, editing questions, and upvoting answers. I also kindly re-direct people to other SE sites when appropriate, or help people re-phrase their questions to be more appropriate here.</p>

<p>As a web engineer, I have a lot of experience with web site features. I can see shortcomings in functionality, and have posted a few suggestions on the meta site. </p>

<p>Contributing to this community in a more direct way would be fun for me. I'm already doing a bit of leg-work, suggesting that moderators look at content and asking users to improve their posts. I think it would save the moderators time to just have me take care of these kinds of problems, rather than have them take a look as well.</p>

7,"<p>The title is self explanatory: where to draw the line between data science specific questions, suited for the <em>Data Science SE</em>, and coding questions that are more appropriate for <em>StackOverflow</em>?</p>

7,"<p>The StackExchange software does not allow you to add beta sites as migration targets.  Open Data is a beta site, so can't be listed as another migration target on that screen.</p>

<p>Regardless of what options are listed on that screen, you can always flag the question for moderator attention and suggest to moderators that they might want to consider migrating it, and you can still vote to close it as off-topic for this site.</p>

<p>That said, if the question is on-topic for this site, as a general rule of thumb it ordinarily should not be forcibly migrated to another site without the original poster's consent.  So, if you see a question that you think is on-topic here but might get even better answers somewhere else, please don't ask the moderators to migrate it without checking with the original author first.  Instead, in that situation a better approach is to post a comment mentioning the possibility of migration to the original poster and tell them how they can flag their post for migration if they want.</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the question is on-topic here, post a comment (but do not vote to close or flag for moderator attention).</p></li>
<li><p>If the question is off-topic here, vote to close it as off-topic.  Optionally, you can flag it for moderator attention (if you think it's a good question and would be well-received at the target site), or you can post a comment letting the original author know how to do that if they choose.</p></li>

7,"<p>Yes, it seems kind of oppressive that the StackExchange convention is to not bother signing off a question with ""thank you, I'm looking forward to your answers"" but the culture of SE prizes direct, efficient questions, and people go so far as to delete extraneous communication like this.</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether you mean you had this text edited out of your question though. I think it's appropriate to upvote a good answer, and maybe comment on the answer saying it's a good reply.

7,"<p>Tough one, since I can imagine questions that overlap both SEs. </p>

<p>Within that domain, sometimes questions really mean an approach, algorithm or technique -- that seems better here than <code>softwarerecs</code>. Asking for a library is less clear, but still feels more in the spirit of this SE. I personally wouldn't migrate those.</p>

<p>Asking for a software product could go either way, to me. </p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I was very interested when I found this branch of StackOverflow, and initially the questions and answers seemed rare, but reasonably interesting.</p>

<p>Lately I see, for example, 4 out of 11 active questions being asked by a single user, on trivial steps of a textbook stuff. I also see extremely general useless questions (what is data science, how to become data scientist).</p>

<p>I personally would be interested in the professional part of some combination of cross validated, data science and the algorithms tag on stackoverflow, in order to see how professional people solve problems.. Maybe the questions by all kinds of beginners could be asked in a single big stackoverflow.com.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I was involved on the Open Data SE from its early ages. We had the same problem there. What we forget is that both Open Data and Data Science are in beta version. And Data Science has really low statistics.</p>

<p>The most important tasks that WE can do to improve the quality of the website, is to bring more traffic from Google search. How we did it?</p>

<p>If one knows a great example of a possible question + answer on the subject, he makes the question, wait for a few days and if no-one give a decent answer, he/she gives the one that is better.</p>

<p>The results are amazing, because we will end up in a short period with great quality questions + answers. Not only quantity. </p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I think that the following simple logic should be applied. If a question is in its <strong>essence</strong> more about data science (models, approaches, methods, tools, etc.), where a programming language represents just a <em>context</em>, then such question fits <em>Data Science SE</em> site better. If, alternatively, the situation is reversed, where programming (coding) aspects are the core of the question, while data science represents context, such question should be asked on (or migrated to) <em>StackOverflow</em> (with a corresponding tag, i.e. <code>r</code>, <code>python</code>). I think that purely a fact of using a language, popular in data science community, as a context, does not justify a question to be considered on-topic on <em>Data Science SE</em> site. We can find an example of such situation in <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/6773/2452"">this purely R programming question</a>.</p>

<p>It is important to ask questions on the most appropriate site, as, per SE rules, if a question is answered, it cannot be migrated to the other site, even, if that site is the most appropriate (other rules also apply in this case). There are other negative potential side effects of migration as well.</p>

7,"<p>Reproducing a similar <a href=""https://stats.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2667/creating-a-new-tag-for-julia-language"">question</a> from the Cross Validated's meta forum.</p>

<p>Creating tags just because there might be questions on the tag is unnecessary.</p>

<p>However, if there are any questions which might use the tag, then creating one is very much advised.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>There is a flood of doubts and articles all over the internet (Quora accounts for a significant amount of such questions) about data science.</p>

<p>But, very few of them know about the existence of the Data Science SE, which is a much more professional and dedicated site for addressing such doubts. So, how can the site be promoted and make it's value known?</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>One of the pretty obvious solutions is to actively promote Data Science SE site by mentioning it on relevant web sites, blogs, etc. Specifically, on Quora, you can mention this site in your answers as well as linking to relevant questions or answers here.</p>

<p>Having said that, while DS SE is a dedicated data science site, unfortunately I have to disagree that it is more professional (which should be the case, in theory), as I see a large number of high quality questions, answers and posts on Quora in relevant categories.</p>

<p>Quora has its own share of problems, discussing which is beyond the scope of this answer (and I don't have time for that, anyway), however, many experienced data scientists are active on Quora and likely don't see reasons to split their activities between it and DS SE. It is a problem for this site and I don't have a perfect solution for that.</p>

<p>As for ""flood of doubts and articles ... about data science"", promoting this site IMHO will not change that at all. This is because all those ""doubts and articles"" are less of factual nature and more of opinions and discussions nature, which, by design, clearly represent a better fit for sites, such as Quora, forums, blogs, etc., rather than more factual-based sites, such as Data Science SE.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I think <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/?tab=active"">Cross Validated</a> is a more inclusive site than Data Science. The scope of Cross validated includes  machine learning. I wonder what is the reason of this site proposals? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cross Validated is a question and answer site for people interested in
  statistics, <strong>machine learning</strong>, data analysis, data mining, and data
  visualization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Data Science Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for Data
  science professionals, <strong>Machine Learning</strong> specialists, and those
  interested in learning more about the field.</p>
</blockquote>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Yes, there's overlap, and with Stack Overflow too. If Cross Validated = Stats and Stack Overflow = engineering, and Data Science is stats + engineering, then that's fine.</p>

<p>I don't perceive Cross Validated as more inclusive. It's probably not a good place to ask about engineering model building at scale or data munging. Those might fit on Stack Overflow since it's pretty broad, but, do seem to have a better home here.</p>

<p>I agree it's still an open question whether there is enough distinct identity here to sustain an SE site. It's growing, but slowly. It's not obviously wrong though.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I agree with @SeanOwen (+1), but I would use even stronger words, because the difference is exactly the <strong>opposite</strong> from what you are suggesting. Clearly, it is data science that is a much larger domain, comprised of many disciplines and related technologies, areas and aspects, where statistics (the focus of <em>Cross Validated</em>) is just a part, even though a critically important one.</p>

<p>Therefore, while <em>Data Science SE</em> formally is ""inclusive"", as you put it, separation of content by focus, as Sean noted, leads, in my opinion, to existing <strong>best practices</strong>: questions, focusing on programming, best fit StackOverflow; questions, focusing on statistics, best fit Cross Validated; questions, focusing on data science aspects, with exceptions of the two above-mentioned, best fit Data Science SE (i.e., data manipulation, model building, machine learning, big data tools, data workflows, data science infrastructure and, I would say, even the relevant career-related topics).</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I used to have a similar doubt, when I was starting to use both the sites.</p>

<p>But, after experiencing enough of them, I had <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/266067/difference-between-the-cross-validated-and-data-science-se-sites"">self-answered my question</a> on the Meta SE site. And your question is eerily similar to mine. (But, it is a very popular question for starters of both the communities.)</p>

<p>Data Science SE as @AleksandrBlekh and @SeanOwen has nicely put, has a lot of content overlapping with CrossValidated.</p>

<p>But, a significant chunk of questions and posts here, would not be on-topic on CV and SO.</p>

<p>For example: my <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/8244/what-makes-columnar-databases-suitable-for-data-science"">question</a> on Columnar Databases in the Data science domain, would be off-topic elsewhere but here; as it specifically asks for this domain, and is also very important and prominent concept.</p>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I disagree with @Air's answer. Datasets are a basic component of Data Science, there is no Data Science without datasets in the same way that there is no Data Science without Machine Learning. Should we then remove all questions related to Machine Learning and put it in <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/"">Cross Validated</a>?  Should we remove questions related to optimization and add it to <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/"">Mathematics</a>. It is the same.</p>

<p>I think you are all forgotten the main purpose of this site, and maybe it is because SO don't specifically put it in the titles of the sites. The main purpose is to <strong>help</strong> people to solve their problems. All the rest is secondary. </p>

<p>If we don't allow to post questions about things strongly related to data science, then we are not helping. If we put many barriers to questions, people will be afraid to ask, we are not helping. If we get crazy about the location of questions or things like what is a perfect question, we are not helping. </p>

<p>Finally, if this place is not for helping people, then SO is really off-topic, and people will to other sites. </p>

<p>NOTE: Right now I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give an opinion (sustained with logical evidences). I might be wrong about this issue, and I know that somebody would argue that in another site there might be a higher change for answers (or maybe not), however, if the matter is deeply related I really think it is more important to focus on answering and helping.</p>

<p>Question: Machine learning algorithm to predict product service requests</p>

<p>Mathematica code below as I could not get it to work in R and OP asked to see what was done with Mathematica. More information on any of the functions can be found at the <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/language/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wolfram Language &amp; System Documentation Center</a>. If you are wondering all functions/packages there are included standard with Mathematica so no need to purchase additional packages.</p>

<p>Import all rows and columns 1, 2, 7, and 9 from the first sheet of the spreadsheet.</p>

<pre><code>data = Import[
   FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[], ""Sample_Set.xlsx""}], 
    {""XLSX"", ""Data"", 1, All, {1, 2, 7, 9}}];
</code></pre>

<p>Clean items that are missing at least column entry. Also, drop header row.</p>

<pre><code>cleanedData = Select[! Or @@ ((# == """") &amp; /@ # ) &amp;]@Rest@data;
</code></pre>

<p><code>(# == """") &amp;</code> is a nested pure function that is <code>Map</code>ed (<code>/@</code>) over each entry of each row to create a list of equality test to <code>""""</code>.  <code>Or</code> is <code>Apply</code>ed (<code>@@</code>) to the list and negated (<code>!</code>) to <code>Select</code> only those rows that have an entry in all columns. <code>Rest</code> drops the first row and keeps the <em>rest</em>.</p>

<p>Format into  example->class for Classify function.  The customer request comment is split into words and restricted to words that can be found in the dictionary.
The {action, part} pairs are joined into one field <em>action+"":""+part</em>.</p>

<pre><code>classifyFormatted = (
     {
       Select[Length[DictionaryLookup[#, 1]] &gt; 0 &amp;]@TextWords@ToLowerCase[#[[1]]], #[[2]]
     } -&gt; #[[3]] &lt;&gt; "":"" &lt;&gt; #[[4]]) &amp; /@ cleanedData;
</code></pre>

<p>Map over each row of <code>cleanedData</code> to create a rule per row of<br>
<code>{list of dictionary words from comment, issue} -&gt; action+"":""+part</code></p>

<p>Drop items for which no dictionary words were found in the customer request.</p>

<p>cleanedClassifyFormatted = Select[classifyFormatted, Length[#[[1, 1]]] != 0 &amp;];</p>

<p>For each row check the length of the first sub-item of the first item (the list of dictionary words) is not zero.</p>

<p>Remove duplicate entries.</p>

<pre><code>cleanedClassifyFormatted = DeleteDuplicates[cleanedClassifyFormatted];
</code></pre>

<p>Now we are left with 427 items from the original 499.</p>

<pre><code>Dimensions@cleanedClassifyFormatted
(* 427 *)
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>Classify</code> to create a <code>ClassifierFunction</code>.  I let the selection algorithm choose the best method instead of explicitly selecting one. I also leave the last 27 items to test the classifier by passing in from the 1st to the 28th-last items only.</p>

<pre><code>c1 = Classify[cleanedClassifyFormatted[[1 ;; -28]]];

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w5ug0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w5ug0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The output tells us that there are 136 classes from 400 observations based on 2 features.</p>

<p>Test classification on last 27 entries.</p>

<pre><code>Transpose@{c1 /@ cleanedClassifyFormatted[[-27 ;;]][[All, 1]],

<p>As you can see it does not predict very well.  Looking at the <code>Tally</code> of the top ten classes we see that there may not be enough support for all classes.</p>

<pre><code>(SortBy[-#[[2]] &amp;]@Tally[cleanedClassifyFormatted[[1 ;; -28, 2]]])[[
  1 ;; 10]] // TableForm
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SzX1a.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SzX1a.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Examining how may items have a particular tally we see that the is not enough support across all classes for a reasonable classification.</p>

<pre><code>TableForm[
 Sort@Tally[Tally[cleanedClassifyFormatted[[1 ;; -28, 2]]][[All, 2]]],
 TableHeadings -&gt; {None, {""Tally"", ""Num Items""}}]
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kZnsz.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kZnsz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Most of the classes have one observation so and only 1 has 41 observations.  The sample does not have enough observations for the pairs.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Update</strong></h2>

<p>Added just classifying the part used to give get more support for the classes.</p>

<p>Reused <code>cleanedClassifyFormatted</code> and just <code>StringDrop</code>ed the part before the "":"" from the rule of each entry.</p>

<pre><code>cCF2 = #[[1]] -&gt; StringDrop[#[[2]], StringPosition[#[[2]], "":"", 1][[1, 1]]] &amp; /@ cleanedClassifyFormatted;
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can execute the same commands as above to classify with this set.</p>

<p>The free text with sample size is the biggest limiter for this. I've attempted to create some structure with it by keeping only words that are found in the dictionary but there are still a lot of variations there. If you have them, I would suggest adding more structured fields like type of appliance, age of appliance, brand, and so on.  These better define the classes. </p>

<p>You should also read up on the <code>Method</code> options of <code>Classify</code> and select the ones best suited for your data.</p>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>More than one SE site has the problem that low quality questions may get closed fairly quickly, but that response time when an OP has made a good effort to fix their question seems very long in comparison. On a site other than Data Science I have had a question closed, put in what I think is the relevant fix from the comments I received, and that question is <em>still</em> closed with no apparent response from anyone two years later.</p>

<p>On Data Science I <em>think</em> this may apply here: <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/10329/training-deep-nets-on-an-ordinary-laptop"">Training Deep Nets on an Ordinary Laptop</a> - although I cannot tell how many people have reviewed the question post-edit and decided to leave it closed.</p>

<p>It seems wrong to leave a question (and the OP) hanging for a long time after a good faith edit has been made. The speed to close compared to the apparent lack of response to reopen when an OP has made an effort feels wrong.</p>

<p>Is there anything we can do to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Provide feedback to OP on whether their changes are considered <em>good enough</em> to reopen a closed question. I can provide a personal opinion in a comment, but that seems empty as I do not speak for anyone else here and can promise nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve response times for reopening, so that Data Science rewards effort put in to fixing questions and meeting guidelines.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For instance, is there a way to tweak number of reopen votes necessary, or to base the number required on the daily traffic to the site (which is lower than e.g. Cross Validated)? Could we show the OP the reopen vote count, or encourage reopen queue reviewers to add a comment if just a little bit more from the OP would help?</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>You are right that the asker answered the initial close reason. I think it's still too open-ended since the asker is wondering what would be instructive to play with on a laptop, so I'd close it again on those grounds.</p>

<p>I disagree that anything's been left hanging; it's just 24 hours since the question was even asked.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>That is a wonderful point, Neil.</p>

<p>However, we being a small community as of now, have a significant advantage in that aspect. </p>

<p>I, personally voted to re-open several questions, which have been re-opened fairly quick, sometimes with Sean's vote and sometimes with other contributors' votes.</p>

<p>So, I can vouch for the fact that questions which have been edited and improved by the OP are taken sincerely and reopened fairly quick.</p>

<p>(As far as the laptop question is concerned, I have voted to re-open it as I found it fairly narrowed down. Yeah, it would need some more improvements, but those can be done while the reopening process is going on, as the edits make the question on-topic here).</p>

<li><a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/"">Cross Validated</a> has evolved to a far more abstract Q&amp;A site (so you talk more about the mathematics and less about how to use them, it has a strong community of statisticians).</li>

<p>Generally speaking I think this community is a good idea. It just needs time to gain more followers, credibility and, perhaps more importantly, identity.

7,"<p>Ten month ago, I asked <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/8587/12527"">What are references explaining Hugo Steinhaus early “data science” work?</a>. It remains unanswered.</p>

<p>It seemed to me it was  legitimate on SE.DataScience at this time. Although mathematician, Steinhaus worked on a lot of applied topics, devised early data science tools, and did ""invent"" k-means. Plus:</p>

<ul>
<li>data science is a novel field, probably not yet identified as a science <em>per se</em> by others</li>
<li>such questions appear on SE.Stats.SE or SE.Math. </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, @aventurin suggested the question would fit better in  <a href=""https://hsm.stackexchange.com/"">History of science and mathematics</a>. However, according to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-work"">Meta: what is migration and how does it work</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only questions which are less than 60 days old can be migrated; this
  rule applies also to moderators. Developers are able to bypass this
  restriction, but they only do so in very, very rare cases.</p>

<p>Plus, I do not have the reputation to do it directly. What are your suggestions?</p>

<ul>
<li>keep it here,</li>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>There is a common question type that gets down voted or closed here. Rightly so in my opinion. However, I think the steady stream of similar questions needs somewhere we can point them.</p>

<p>Typical scenario is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A beginner to machine learning has a data set, imagined or real, and a problem to solve.</p></li>
<li><p>As a beginner, they are confused about selecting the ""best"" modelling approach. There are loads of choices to make after all, and most involve learning about the model class and an API for it in some framework.</p></li>
<li><p>The question is presented better than ""Here's some data, what do I do?"" or ""Give me the model?"" questions in that the poster is aware of some options in front of them and has a real problem that they are trying to solve themselves. However, despite trying, they have still managed to post a question that is badly framed or too broad.</p></li>
<li><p>The question is at a fork in the road - either the poster could share more concrete details about what they are doing, or they could simply be encouraged to try and test their own ideas. Both could be acceptable outcomes, it is not 100% clear whether the problem needs more guidance than ""What I'd do is try all 3 of your ideas and test them - so why don't you do the same?"".</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The reality is that even with a lot of experience, second-guessing the best model for a problem is not how things work. Instead an expert will typically explore the data and problem, select a metric to measure success, then try a range of possible models and feature engineering, testing each.</p>

<p>I think the asker's desire is to get some help through the model selection maze. However, they tend to forget how unique each data problem often is, and/or seem to think that more experienced ML experts will somehow know what to do, sometimes only with the problem domain, a hand-waving description of the data and a rough goal.</p>

<p>I'd like either this question, or even a canonical duplicate, to serve as a pointer to how the posters could improve their questions so that they can be answered and/or to be a frame challenge - i.e. the experts don't just read literature looking for ""best solution to problem X"", in fact they mostly just try and test stuff; the best thing is to learn the skills that enable the asker to do the same.</p>

<p>This is certainly true.  But can't more be said on each of these points?  What does explore mean (and do different problems have data exploration)?  What are typical metrics of success is each problem?  What kind of features might be good to engineer for the problem at hand?  With models, are there models to try as a baseline first?  </p>

<p>I think there is a lot of process to unpack here.  Certainly there are a lot of questions posed which have too few details; your complaint, however is about all such questions, not just vague the ones.

So a question about, say, R and NLP is on-topic, although we've usually said that questions that are just about programming and using R at heart belong on SO. Although these concern usage of a tool too, I don't think they're relevant to SO. When in doubt I'd say leave them open.</p>

7,"<p>You've been cleared for graduation by the Stack Exchange Community Team! Data Science met our threshold for <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites"">graduation-worthy sites</a> and after a review, the Community Team determined that you're good to go. Reaching 'mature community' status is a big milestone, and you should be very proud.</p>

<p>What does this mean exactly? Graduation works in two phases. Starting today, you'll receive the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will have an election for community moderators - we currently have a somewhat backed up election schedule that got bumped a bit, so your election is currently set to begin collecting questions on <strong>July 24th</strong>. </li>
<li>You will no longer see the ""beta"" label attached to your site's name</li>
<li>You will become eligible for question migration paths with the rest of the network</li>
<li>You will soon be able to select your own community ads. This thread will go up probably next week as we have another graduation setup and this will allow us to batch handle the hookups.</li>
</ul>

<p>The site will still receive a full design from one of our designers, which will be packaged with an increase in the amount of reputation needed to access each privilege. It's no secret that our backlog for site designs is long, so instead of making you wait to receive all the parts of graduation at once, we wanted to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260754/feedback-requested-design-independent-graduation"">give you the things we could give</a> you now. We think we've hammered out most of the bugs in the process,, but there are still likely to be some left -  so if you come across anything out of place, please report it on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/"">Meta Stack Exchange</a> using the [graduating-sites] tag.</p>

<p>This site has reached this point because of your generous contributions. Together, you've created a valuable resource that helps people. Congratulations on all you've accomplished.</p>

7,"<p>I'm proposing the renaming/synonymizing of <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scikit"">[scikit]</a> tag to [scikit-learn].</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<ul>
<li>The tag has the form [scikit-learn] also in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scikit-learn"">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scikit-learn"">Cross Validated</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Also, the tag should be synonymized with <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sklearn"">[sklearn]</a> tag.</p>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>That sounds reasonable to me. I have implemented both of those mappings now.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I'd also say yes. </p>

<p>What is visualization used for?</p>

<ol>
<li>During your <strong>own</strong> data exploration process, plotting is essential </li>
<li>You  have to communicate results to <strong>other scientists or peers</strong> from your
experts group (goal: produce polished scientific graphs) </li>
<li>You have to
convince the <strong>non-expert stakeholders</strong>: the general public, your
manager or supervisor, some colleagues - these are different
visualization tasks (goal is more like producing infographics)</li>
</ol>

<p>However, to accomplish this (in my opinion) you also need <em>fluency</em> in different visualizations software ecosystems: your preferred plotting system  that you use in your <strong>analyis workflow</strong> (e.g. ggplot2 from the R ecosystem, matplotlib from python). </p>

<p>For your own <strong>communication/publication workflow</strong>, you need some HTML/Javascript widget library (such as Shiny, Leaflet, ... or commercial products such as Tableau) to make visualisations interactive, animated;  generally to put visualizations online. Often this publication step is optional but I think having this skillset  it makes you (as an employee, at least) more valuable. </p>

<p>I think this fluency and awareness of visualization needs of different audiences, and a certain mastery of web-technologies distinguishes a data scientist from a true statistician or ML/AI person who is less skilled in (3).</p>

7,"<p>Data Science is scheduled for its graduation election <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/election/1"">next week, July 31st</a>.In connection with that, we will be holding a Q&amp;A with the candidates.  This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The purpose of this thread was to collect questions for the questionnaire. The questionnaire is now live, and you may find it <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2291/2017-moderator-election-qa-questionnaire"">here</a>.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Until the nomination phase, (so, until Monday, July 31st at 20:00:00Z UTC, or 4:00 pm EDT on the same day, give or take time to arrive for closure), this question will be open to collect potential questions from the users of the site. Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post <em>one question per answer</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>If your question contains a link, please use the syntax of <code>[text](link)</code>, as that will make it easier for transcribing for the finished questionnaire.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at currently.</p></li>
<li><p>At the start of the nomination phase, the Community Team will select <strong>up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community</strong> provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. </p></li>
<li><p>Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, typically containing 10 questions in total.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&amp;A.</p></li>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I did not downvote them, but I can understand why, to some extent. My quick evaluation (and speculation?) of the example questions follows. Please take them with a bit of salt. Also note that 4 out of 5 were deleted (as of 2017-08-12), which also proves their lack of quality.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the first question, I had left a comment already: it could use some rewriting in order to make it look less broad, as right now it looks like 4 questions in one.</li>
<li>The 2nd one could probably benefit from a minimal example in code of what they have done so far, while cutting the initial explanation a bit shorter. It would be unfortunate if askers and future visitors had to read all 7 paragraphs before getting to the actual question.</li>
<li>The third one could use some clarifications, so I left a comment inviting the OP to provide an example and to show what was attempted so far.</li>
<li>Number 4 could also use some more code to better understand the kind of function they're looking for.</li>
<li>And finally, 5 is asking two questions and does not seem to show much research effort. In fact, at least the first part of the question has been covered before on this site: <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/10926/17538"">HOW TO: Deep Neural Network weight initialization</a> and <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/19170/17538"">What is the purpose of setting an initial weight on deep learning model?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So no, I don't believe that questions are being downvoted because of being about deep learning, nor do I believe that deep learning questions are a problem here. In fact, I hope to see the Data Science SE community embrace good quality questions about deep learning, as they often reach the two ends of the science-technology spectrum to the point of being <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/354028/1233251"">hard to know where to ask them across the SE network</a>.</p>

<p>As an ending note: do not forget to upvote good questions. With sufficient triage from the community, those downvotes will not be as significant.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I have been browsing through the Data Science SE for last couple of months almost everyday along with other SE sites. I noticed that, in general, the questions asked on Data Science SE is often of poor quality. Many users are asking questions that are often too broad, just throwing out random idea and asking what others think and in most cases, they do not show any code or minimal reproducible example.</p>

<p>This is (mostly) not the case on stackOverflow questions (even in tags under R, Python questions which are the two main tools used by the community of DS SE). </p>

<p>The questions on data science are often difficult to ask because of issues like the nature of question (i.e. they are often not straightforward <code>how do I do it using this language</code> question) and reproducible codes may take some time to run due to the training process etc.</p>

<p>I am hoping that the community here can come up with a framework to ask great data science question. Hence, my question is:</p>

<p>I believe the answers should 'answer' following questions with good examples to follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to be specific in asking a data science question?</li>
<li>How to produce a minimal working example for data science questions?</li>
<li>Is it possible to provide a complete list of dataset that may cover a broad variety of questions asking in future? If possible, new questions can pick one that suits them most and use that to produce MWE codes.</li>

<p>As Data Science and ML is a domain which is being adopted by a lot of students and engineers these days, the huge influx of newbie questions is justified.</p>

<p>However, questions which demonstrate lack of basic googling and search efforts would need to be discouraged. However, there is no need to be harsh on them, as they might not know how and what to google. So, we can help them by commenting on their questions and closing them off. </p>

<p>So, questions like <code>How do I get started in Data Science?</code> or <code>How do I build my career in Data science</code> <strong>will be closed</strong> as they're very broad. But, pin-pointed questions about references and helpful resources like <code>Are there any helpful resources for learning the concept of trend smoothening in time series analysis</code> welcome as <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;reference-request&#39;"" rel=""tag"">reference-request</a> questions.</p>

<p>The <code>Why is my code not workng?</code> belongs in the SO's main site, even if 
that code is completely ML-related, cause it's debugging help and not specifically related to Data science.

<p>As the user is already a regular contributor, there is a very high probability he/she understands the culture of the site. So, dealing with his/her problems in chat with the mods and other contributors is the ideal way forward.  However, I am a big believer of the Be Nice policy of SE. A site would be much better off not having toxic users, even though they're very high-profile. If the culture is friendly and welcoming, we can attract more users everyday.</p>

<p>Many other Stack Exchange sites close questions that simply ask for off-site resources. </p>

<p>I'd like to vote to close this question as off-topic, but I don't feel confident yet that the site consensus is that it <em>is</em> off topic (as opposed to just a low-quality question). The list of standard off-topic reasons does not support me closing, and we also do have some successful resource request questions, for more generic resources such as ""deep learning libraries for Python"" or identifying courses and learning materials. </p>

<li><p>Should the linked question be off-topic - why/why not?</p></li>
<li><p>Are any resource search questions on-topic for Data Science site, if so what is difference between acceptable and unacceptable ones?</p></li>

  <ol>
  <li>Would you prefer to more aggressively filter out low-quality newbie questions and improve the experience for advanced data science users, or prefer to leave open and encourage improvement of newbie questions to make the site more useful to newcomers in the field?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So there are two different important points in one question:</p>

<ul>
<li>The whole point is to answer questions in our field yes? So any question is welcome as long as they are <strong>valid</strong> which I write about bellow. We will be happy if we can motivate newbies to learn more and improve their theoretical and practical answers for sure!</li>
<li>But there is a BUT!!! No one can deny the recent raise of ""let's be a Data Scientist"" and I believe massive popularity usually reduces the intellectual properties of concepts. This has happened to Data Science recently and it's a good approach to protect the scientific soul of the field by editing and improving answers and questions instead of ignoring them. We can help keeping the scientific aspect of the field this way. For example:

<ul>
<li>If the question is not clear, <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/18167/clustering-multiple-networks/18178#18178"">then make it clear</a>. If it's very basic then be happy, <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9758/overfitting-underfitting-with-data-set-size/9760#9760"">we can clarify fundamental concepts</a>. If it contains a misunderstanding of a concept, <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9038/purpose-of-visualizing-high-dimensional-data/9126#9126"">then we should correct it</a>. If the question is too long <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9724/deciding-about-dimensionality-reduction-classification-and-clustering/9779#9779"">then take your time</a> and even if a question (or a part of it) is basically wrong or shows lack of necessary background, <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/19137/similarity-between-an-n-dimensional-curve-and-selected-subsets-of-them/19173#19173"">just correct it</a> to enrich the community and prevent misunderstanding, instead of deleting it. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>The last but not the least is the archive aspect of SE. Let's keep it as a massive collection of QA in the field so filtering questions and answers out is the opposite way! We need to <strong>correct</strong> them.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>Do you think code debugging-help style questions are on-topic on this site? If yes, then how do we decide on the scope of them? For ex: <code>Why is my code not running?</code> style questions vs <code>Why is this module not taking this hyperparameter?</code> style questions. And so on.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutly yes! They are on-topic as long as they are prog. questions related to DS. It's great that we can act like between theory and practice. And coding sometimes pains! We can help each other to save much time by answering coding questions. The other point is that it enriches the archive characteristic of SE by keeping questions in different aspects.</p>

<p>Deciding about the scope is not easy because there is no border. I would say any coding question showing up <strong>in a DS project</strong> is welcome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>What types of questions are on-topic for Data Science but not Cross Validated, or vice versa? or, what types of questions are on-topic for both?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is a must to have Cross-Validated, then I have a concrete answer for this question which was my question as well. DS-related fields are heavily based on Statistics plus the fact that a huge part of Data Analysis is actually Statistics itself. So I would say Statistics-related questions in DS field better to go on Cross-Validated and the other parts here. A concrete example is PCA algorithm. I would say if someone has question about calculating Covariance matrix we can say $X^TX$ here. But if someone asks ""<em>Why $X^TX$ can be used as Cov matrix?</em>"" the math explanation can be in Cross-Validated.
I would like to mention that at the end of the day I wouldn't mind combining both sites actually! (I even recommend it and I have a reason for that)</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""4"">
  <li>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't see any problem in this user! Thanks for his activities and contributions! Flags, etc. are also contributions. It's what a collaborative discussion means.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""5"">
  <li>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said, for me SE is all about discussions. You just make your comment about it. And yes, sometimes mistakes happen in an irreversible way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""6"">
  <li>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>To be honest I am new to this! I think it's a bunch of experts who <strong>maintain the quality</strong> of DSSE not a team of dictators who think anyone should ask/answer a question in the way they like. Diversity of minds is the only treasure we have here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""7"">
  <li>A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't see a problem. Not only moderators in SE but in general anyone who takes a responsibility toward the benefit of many others should be as transparent as possible. I support this POV.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""8"">
  <li>In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>They are different things I suppose! Being a moderator is about maintaining the quality of everything but having high-rep may even mean a huge passion in the field without feeling responsibility! There is a different between the star of a football team and the manager! None of them does (and is supposed to do) the job of other one.</p>

<p>Hope my answers helps making decision :)</p>

<p>Since the comment was up voted 5 times, it means that the question was not so stupid/irrelevant/[your definition of bad question].</p>

<p>If we down vote each question that the right answer is RTFM, StackExchange should have 80% of its questions with a negative score. </p>

<p>It also prevent some people to ask good questions fearing to be down voted.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I didn't downvote it, but think it's not wrong. The asker didn't seem to try to research the question, because it would have been clear quickly that the question's premise doesn't quite make sense.</p>

<p>One thing StackExchange does seem to reward is well-researched questions, where the asker is investing time just like the answerers are requested to. And so SEs do discourage questions that don't seem to show effort. And yes, most questions on SE sites are bad, IMHO. Fortunately voting surfaces the 5% that are useful.</p>

<p>The question wasn't closed or anything, someone just registered an opinion about it. If someone takes it personally and doesn't ask more questions, well, probably not the place for it. SE does not have to be the right resource for everyone.</p>

<p>The sites can be fine for newbies, if they're asking thoughtful questions that are not readily answered already. Most newbie questions tend to be already answered somewhere, so they're more frequently downvoted here. So SEs seem like they are more suitable for experienced practitioners.</p>

<p><strong>Would you prefer to more aggressively filter out low-quality newbie questions and improve the experience for advanced data science users, or prefer to leave open and encourage improvement of newbie questions to make the site more useful to newcomers in the field?</strong></p>

<p>I tend to like the later option more, but I would definitely implement some elements of the former.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><strong>What types of questions are on-topic for Data Science but not Cross Validated, or vice versa? or, what types of questions are on-topic for both?</strong></p>

<p>DS and CV are overlapping, that is the reality. In my opinion, CV should contain questions with emphasis to pure statistics. DS covers fairly more diverse areas. In the end, the decision would be made by community.</p>

<p><strong>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</strong></p>

<p>I judge people equally. If one consistently behaves in a bad manner in comment areas, I will treat him/her the same, according to guidelines, and no matter how many answers he/she gave.</p>

<p>I would express my opinion to the other moderator.</p>

<p><strong>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</strong></p>

<p>The point of being the moderator is making community more interesting to participants. The means of achieving that are various.</p>

7,"<p>In accordance to Grace's <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2298/11097"">previous post</a>, we need at least <code>n+1</code> candidates for a successful election, where <code>n</code> is the number of moderator slots available. In our case, it is <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>Currently, we have 3 candidates up for the nomination. There is still 6 hours left for the nomination. So, people who were interested in moderating the site, but were not sure, this is the time to throw in your hats.</p>

<p>As this is the postponed date, if there are not enough people up for the nomination, then the election would be terminated and would be left for the community to be decided.</p>

<p>We have been awesome together in bringing this site to the status of a graduated site. So, let's step up for moderating it, and making it more useful and helpful for fellow data science enthusiasts :)</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>We regret to inform that due to insufficient nominating candidates, we are currently terminating the ongoing election here on Data Science Stack Exchange. As <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2298/moderator-election-we-need-more-candidates"">explained previously</a>, in order for an election to proceed to voting phases it is required that there is at least one more candidate than there are spaces remaining in the election. </p>

<p>This is important for a variety of reasons. The first is that it allows the election process to proceed in a way that allows candidates to be evaluated before being elected. It also serves to indicate that there are enough people in the community who are willing to handle the responsibilities of overseeing moderation. While only a certain number of moderators will actually be elected, the full moderation of a site is done by a lot more than just the moderators alone. An election that thus fails to receive enough candidates, implies a shortage of interest in moderation effort on the site. As this is the site's graduation election, this is very much not a good sign.</p>

<hr>

<p>The vast majority of flags on Data Science are handled currently by a single moderator. This isn't a testament to the size of the queue (as, befitting a site that passed metrics for graduation, this site is moderately active), but because there is only one moderator actively performing the duty. Normally this would call for replacement pro tem moderators to be appointed by us. However, as we believed Data Science to have activity and reputation levels fit for supporting an election, we figured that holding a proper election would handle the task well.</p>

<p>However, this was not a successful endeavor. In the first week, only two candidates nominated until the very end of the nomination phase. An entire week went by without anyone new nominating. Sean Owen mentioned several names in the community who could consider running, but among the ones who still visit the site regularly, none answered the call. </p>

<p>At this stage it's important for us to figure out what the core issue here is. Are people unaware that there's an election going on and that there are these meta posts popping up? Are people open to the idea of running, but didn't choose to do so because they were expecting others to run? Was there genuinely no interest, whether it is by not having the bandwidth to perform the duties or by not desiring to partake in those duties? </p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Excellent question.  I don't know what the core issue is.  I can't speak for the top users here; I can only speak for myself.  I wasn't paying close attention, because I figured core members of the community would be nominating, and because it seemed like the existing moderation team has been doing a great job and it was likely that at least some of them might run.</p>

<p>Given the shortage of people, I might be open to running.  I'm not as active on this site as the top users, so I don't know if it would be appropriate for me to be a moderator here, but it'd be great to see the site succeed, so if there's a need for candidates, I might be willing to run, given the situation.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Could we have banner on top of the page (throughout the entire election process) instead of the little box on the side? I think the election (and meta posts in general) wasn't displayed prominently enough. </p>

<p>I also think that there are many members who aren't very active or familiar with other SE sites. So, they might be hesitant to chip in, hoping for others to come forward.</p>

<p>I'm confident we would find more people willing to nominate themselves in order to keep this community alive.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I also don't know, but think it was probably lack of awareness. I'd also welcome a much more prominent display about it on the main site.</p>

<p>Maybe many people assumed that Much More Qualified People would nominate themselves, including many of those very Qualified People. There are plenty of people that would do a fine job.</p>

<p>I agree with not graduating until motivated moderators can be found, because I'd prefer not to keep moderating and think I'm the one active one.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I'm wondering if the issue is around a number of areas</p>

<ul>
<li>lack of awareness of the election</li>
<li>lack of knowing who to nominate. I suspect there is a chat room that prospective people would be in for this disucssion</li>
<li>the fact that the forums are very Q&amp;A style, means that there is little interaction between individuals other than the Q&amp;A area. I myself have been using SE sites for a number of years and have very rarely gone into the chat or meta areas.</li>
<li>Also along the lines of ""better qualified people"". Lots of people are perhaps thinking this same thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also would be fine in standing, but am not known by many (or any people in the community).</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>For me personally the reason is the poor quality of DataScience stack exchange at the moment. I hung around here quite a bit at the start, but there were so many poor questions, many badly specified or better suited to SO or CV or /dev/null, that it became a bit of a joke site for a small group of us, so I left. I was surprised by the ""DS is graduating"" message, so I popped back. I don't think the quality has got any better. I just trawled through a bunch of questions with inexcusable poor spelling <em>in the titles</em>, vague problems with non-working code examples, code dumps where the user has made no attempt at basic debugging, and just general dross.</p>

<p>So my time is better spent helping out in SO (and GIS) where the quality and clarity is an order of magnitude better. I hope this site finds its feet eventually but I'm not sure where they are given the overlap with SO and CV.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Two weeks ago, we cancelled the Moderator election for this site on the grounds that there were insufficient candidates. I posted <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2309/community-moderator-election-has-been-cancelled"">this meta post</a> to investigate the source of the problem and determine when, if at all, should the election be rebooted. The responses mostly came in three forms.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There was a lack of awareness that there was an election. This is both folks saying that they weren't actually aware, or that they figured that others who might run were not aware. We will look into things which can help improve awareness if the election is restarted. That said, Meta is an essential part of governance and moderation on a site. With several posts on the topic of the election (the initial announcement, two separate posts on the Q&amp;A, and the extension announcement itself), a separate concern comes up with the lack of overlap in “People who might be interested in moderating” and “People who pay attention to Meta and the status of the election”. Which brings us to...</p></li>
<li><p>The people who are standing up now, are only hesitantly doing so on account of the shortage of candidates. While a hesitant candidate is better than no candidate, it doesn't paint a good picture if the only people standing up are those reluctantly doing so because not enough people are <em>motivated</em> to the task.</p></li>
<li><p>There's people who actively and frontforwardfacingly are <em>disinterested</em> in the prospect. Two such statements were put forth, and it concerns me more because these are relatively high rep users. One noted that there's too much overlap with Cross Validated, while the other finds the current quality of the site to be too poor for interest in moderation. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Dawny33, one of the candidates who stood up during the initial nomination phase, had this to say in response to one of the posts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, this is exactly why it needs more users to be involved in moderation and helping the site, as it grew in volume at a very impressive rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But we don't just need users to be merely involved in the moderation of the site - we need users to have a <em>vested interest</em> in being involved. And I can't say that we're particularly seeing that here. By the volume of question traffic here, we certainly have a topic space - that's what helped qualify you folks for graduation in the first place. But that topic space is as needing of moderators as it is of experts to answer questions. Absent that, it may well be better off folded into one of the larger sites.</p>

<p>So this is our call for action here. A site isn't held atop the pillar of a couple individuals - there may only be three moderators to be elected in an initial election, but <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/"">moderation is a job distributed across the community</a>. I don't want to see people stepping up sheepishly suggesting that they might have enough time to spare. I want to see that there are people who don't just care about this topic but care about <em>this site</em> and making it <em>work</em>. And I want to see <em>more</em> of these people. If that’s you, then now’s your chance to speak up, step up, and start moderating: voting, flagging, editing, identifying and discussing thorny issues when they present themselves. Demonstrate that you have the community that can support the high volume question base that you've accumulated, and stand on your own as a site.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>It all makes sense. In practice, it's odd that we're apparently short of moderator activity, had at least one user (Dawny33) with clear willingness and track record to become a moderator, but can't make this person a moderator. </p>

<p>It looks like a real election is premature, but, can't we swap out/in interim moderators for now? I know we did it before. Is there a process or criteria for that?</p>

<p>All the more because I'd like to pass on the moderator diamond for now, and I think I do most of the moderation.</p>

<p>Firstly, DataScience and CrossValidated <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/266067/302377"">have very clear and separate scopes for each other</a>. So, converging them is a very bad idea. Stats is a part of data science, so the overlap is justified. But, saying DataScience site should be merged into CV is like saying DataScience is nothing but stats. It is not. There are domains like Data Engineering, etc which are not on-topic on CV[explained clearly in the answers linked in the preceding text].</p>

<p>One cannot expect a spotlessly clean quality of posts from a newly graduated site. It takes time, but this site is constantly improving, thanks to all the users in the reviews queue. The user who complained about poor quality hasn't been clear about what they find lacking in the quality. If they can do it, I can also go ahead and address that in detail. + comparing the quality on this site to sites like SO (where there are scores of 20k users) is not justified.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am not sure about the lack of interest amongst users in stepping up to moderating this site. This happened in the recent election of CrossValidated too. The users who stood up, stood up so that the election doesn't get called off.</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself. I come here almost every day asking and answering questions, and I like the helpful response to my questions. I was involved with this site for a long time and enjoyed that time too, so that is why I stepped up.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I understand the comments about low quality questions on this site. They increase the effort to moderate the site and make it seem to people browsing the site for the first time that there is not a lot of value here. This prevents potentially interested users (who might be active on crossvalidate or stackoverflow) to participate here and contribute, which in turn prevents faster improvement of the overall quality of the site.</p>

<p>Maybe something can be done about this upfront that doesn't involve any moderation. When you start formulating a question the only guidance you receive is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How to Ask</p>
  
  <p>Is your question about data science?</p>
  
  <p>We prefer questions that can be <em>answered</em>, not just discussed.</p>

If we can provide some more details what makes a good question this could help everyone. </p>

<p>This should include at least something like if your problem involves a specific dataset, then provide a sufficiently detailed description and/or a sample of it, etc.</p>

<p>On a different note, if the metrics looked good enough for graduation, then I think it's fair to assume that this site will gain further traction and improve in the long-run. If not, maybe the metrics aren't that great...</p>

<p><strong>Data Science Stack Exchange</strong> is a Q&amp;A site for developers, researchers, and anyone else interested in Data Science.</p>
<p>Data Science encompasses machine learning, data mining, and data visualization among other topics.

<p>I can't comment, I can't use chat room. All I can do is post bad questions that are bothersome. I occasionally would like to be able to comment on threads I see that I CAN actually contribute to, but I don't have enough rep. Or hang out in chat and post an occasional message if I see something I've had issues with before/know how to fix. I just want 20 rep for that.</p>

<p>Honestly I dont want to just post fake questions everyday hoping to get rep cause people will downvote that. I have 6 months to live due to a degenerative disease in my spine and I've been trying to learn random things to take my mind off of it. This is my first experience on the internet where you can't just log in and start being part of the community immediately, and its very frustrating.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to get past this without posting bogus questions? Or how to get at least 20 rep for chat? thanks (insert random tags below)</p>

<p>WOW I just came back from cooking some dinner for the family and see that I have 21 rep! Thanks to whoever rep'd me, I wish I could have contributed some groundbreaking programming info, but hey I'll just smile and say thanks! Also thanks again Neil. I think people like you make this place worth it for the newcomers who feel like idiots because they have training wheels on and are afraid to ask anything infront of all the experts. hehe. Appreciate all the help.

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<blockquote>
  <p>I have a new account. I can't comment, I can't use chat room. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a common complaint, but is not something that is considered broken or in need of being fixed. The small rep caps are deliberate, and provide an effective barrier against spam and misuse of additional site features.</p>

<p>The <em>core</em> site features are the ability to ask and answer questions. These are the purpose of Stack Exchange sites, and you have access to those features immediately on creating an account.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All I can do is post bad questions that are bothersome. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't do that. But do ask on-topic questions if you want to. Asking a question here is harder than it seems at first, because the site is looking for <em>high quality</em> questions that explain a specific problem well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I occasionally would like to be able to comment on threads I see that I CAN actually contribute to, but I don't have enough rep. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comments under questions and answers are not really like forums. They are <em>supposed</em> to be about refining details of a question or answer. Most often they are used to ask someone writing a question to add more details, or clarify some part of the question. On answers they might be a suggested correction or extension. </p>

<p>You should bear in mind that comments can get deleted, purely because they are ""just comments"". Some Stack Exchange sites do this routinely, with the admins cleaning up old comments as a matter of course. Data Science does not do this, but might change to doing it at any time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or hang out in chat and post an occasional message if I see something I've had issues with before/know how to fix.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That should be fine. Chat is more open-ended and can be social. Chat rooms spring up for various reasons - most commonly if comments start getting extended. On busy sites, chat often has constant ongoing discussion. On Data Science, we are not so busy in 2017 that you will find lots of chat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any ideas how to get past this without posting bogus questions? Or how to get at least 20 rep for chat? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Posting bogus questions is likely to lose you rep and will be counter-productive.</p>

<p>The quickest way to get 20 rep is to write high quality content in a question or answer. That can be relatively short, and you could pick an easy-to-answer question. Look carefully at the style of answers that get up-voted. They are not chatty, they don't extend questions with ""that's interesting, I also found that..."", they don't just link to possible answers off-site - these things are the norm on most social media and forums, but not here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have 6 months to live due to a degenerative disease in my spine and I've been trying to learn random things to take my mind off of it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a tough break. I hope you have a good support network around you. Stack Exchange sites, for better or worse, cannot really take this sort of thing into account. In some ways this is internet Nirvana - they don't care what age, sex, religion, you are, or what you are like physically. In other ways it is impersonal and unforgiving, because Stack Exchange <em>does care</em> about the quality of your writing and choice of subject matter, and you will be judged for it constantly in questions and answers.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you are looking for a community with an open friendly atmosphere to chat and share ideas, then Stack Exchange is not really it. Not that people are not friendly here, just that the atmosphere is more business like and focused around content production. It has more in common with Wikipedia than an machine learning forum. On the plus side the focus on getting good questions and answers is a great learning resource. On the minus side, it's not a place to make friends. </p>

<p>I suggest, in addition to finding a niche for yourself in Stack Exchange, that you look at other places with a more social atmosphere. Depending on what learning challenges you set yourself, you might find taking part in a free MOOC course will be fun - one classic machine learning course is <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Andrew Ng's Machine Learning on Coursera</a> and a new cohort will be starting soon. The forums there <em>are</em> chatty, and also taking that course might inspire you to ask specific questions here to help you learn.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Welcome to the site. Thank you for making genuine efforts for posting high-quality content here.</p>

<p>As Neil has answered all your queries in detail, I just wanted to put there that there is a <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/65541/data-science-se"">chat room</a> available on the site, where the users can discuss the site and data science in general. </p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>The current description for the tag <code>feature-extraction</code> is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variables (used for prediction or explication) used in regression or
  regression-like models (like clustering, discrimination). Use this tag
  for questions about constructing such variables or selecting the best
  among them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, feature extraction is a step that is not restricted to be use in regression-like models. It is only a data representation used as the first step in most data processing approaches.</p>

<p>The current tag description is misleading and questions that should use this tag are currently not using it if not related to regression models like (<a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/21926/application-of-histogram-of-oriented-gradients-in-colored-image"">this question</a> for example).</p>

<p>What are your suggestions? Should we change the description? and if yes for what?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>My suggestion would be along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In machine learning, pattern recognition and data modeling in general,
  feature extraction is the action of computing variables that contain
  the relevant information from the data, so that the desired task can
  be performed by using a reduced representation instead of the complete
  initial data.</p>

<p>(This is inspired from the Wikipedia page ""Feature extraction"")</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Sure, can you just suggest an edit? it can refer to predictive models in general. Yes, nothing specific to regression.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>When you have a Data Science-related question, there are at least 7 relevant StackExchange sites to choose from. So how do you pick the right one?</p>

<p>Yes, for each question you can first ask on Meta (example: <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2154/what-it-is-the-most-appropriate-stack-exchange-site-to-ask-about-ontologies-and"">What it is the most appropriate Stack Exchange site to ask about ontologies and knowledge bases?</a>), but that's not the best solution. </p>

<p>Can we create a definitive guide (think of a flowchart) that helps to choose the right SE site?</p>

<p>The list of relevant websites:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">StackOverflow</a> (most popular)</li>
<li><a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/"">Data Science</a> (current)</li>
<li><a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/"">Cross Validated</a></li>

<li><a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/"">Theoretical Computer Science</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/"">Computational Science</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I assume that ideally we want to have only 1 correct website per question. All the questions asked on the incorrect websites should be closed/migrated to the correct ones. Otherwise we'll have confusion, duplicate questions and scattered user base. I think that a definitive guide would help both for asking new questions and for migrating the old ones.</p>

7,"<p>Thanks for this.  I love Big and Bold.  But...</p>

<p>So concerning that, let's check the <em>Definition of ideal</em>:</p>

<p>Perfection, by its nature, is rare...  We can strive, but actually reaching that?  Hmm.</p>

<p>Moving on to the meat of your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can we create a definitive guide (think of a flowchart) that helps to choose the right SE site?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that a flow chart would be fabulous, so I want to beleive that the answer is <strong>Yes</strong>.  But someone would need to generate it.  </p>

<p>I doubt I am capable of it, would you like to give it a go?</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>You're right, these SEs overlap to a greater or lesser degree. I'd say use your judgment and post where it seems to fit best. Mods can migrate if they feel strongly about it.</p>

<p>I think the biggest ambiguities here are Cross Validated and Artificial Intelligence. Cross Validated tends to be more stats theory without, necessarily, reference to engineering of software that uses those ideas. </p>

<p>AI overlaps a lot and I personally disagree with it as a separate SE. Although you can define 'data science' and 'artificial intelligence' differently, in common usage, I find they're almost synonyms.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I see this was asked a while ago in <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2143/offer-additional-options-for-off-topic-flag"">Offer Additional Options for &quot;Off Topic&quot; Flag</a> - however this was answered with a clear ""no"" because we were a beta site at the time.</p>

<p>Recently I saw this question: <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/24017/work-breakdown-of-data-project"">Work breakdown of data project</a> and thought it was more suited to Workplace as it is primarily about communication between a project planner and a researcher - the latter happens to be in a data scientist role.</p>

<p>Could we now add a few more sites than the current ""should be on meta"". Obvious choices include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stack Overflow, for coding bugs or advice using core language features not related to data science (perhaps the question asker just happens to be working on a data science problem in that language).</p></li>
<li><p>Workplace, for work relation and behaviour issues that just happen to involve data scientists (<em>maybe</em> - we have a sample of one here that triggered my Meta question)</p></li>
<li><p>Cross Validation - maybe, although we'd need to be clear with ourselves what the boundaries are when something stops being a Data Science issue and starts to be suitable for that site. I am suggesting it regardless though, because having that migration target may give us data samples on what the community thought on this long-running issue.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe other sites would also be suitable, based on potential migrations others have seen on the site? For instance I suggested Cognitive Science Stack Exchange recently for a question, although that is a beta site so not possible.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I think it would be helpful. Some thoughts on the potential list.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://opendata.stackexchange.com/"">Open Data</a> seems to be doing fairly well, and would seem to be a good target for migration. But as a beta site is not an option for migration?  I recently moderator flagged on for migration, I think it got done.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack Overflow - This one can be tricky, because while the question may be programming related, they can often be poor enough quality to not be on topic at SO either.</p></li>

7,"<h3>Why Bother?</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Well for starters, it is not much a bother, since it is trivially easy.  </p>

<p>If you have taken the time to stop by meta to read this, I imagine that you took a look at the questions on the main site first.  Did you vote on any of those that you read?</p></li>
<li><p>Because we need more high reputation users.</p>

<p>As of today we don't have a single 10k user and we only have 9 users with a enough reputation to go to the close/reopen queues with the standard 3k reputation level.</p></li>
<li><p>Votes are signposts for those that come after you.</p>

<p>So voting is good karma.  It helps to communicate your experience and knowledge to others.  Even if it is just a tiny a bit at a time.</p></li>

<h3>Why doesn't anybody vote, is <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com"">Data Science</a> Broken?</h3>

<p>I do not think the site is broken, as other sites have faced the same challenge.  A quick search finds many similar meta posts.  So <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com"">Data Science</a> is traveling a familiar path.</p>

<h3>How can we change the situation?</h3>

<p>Well, <em>you</em> can vote.  Consider this a plea to spend a bit of your time voting whenever <em>you</em> stop by.</p>

<p>Besides, who wouldn't want to <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/badges/6/supporter"">earn</a> a <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/badges/62/suffrage"">nice</a> <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/badges/71/vox-populi"">shiny</a> <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/badges/32/civic-duty"">badge</a> or <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/badges/44/electorate"">two</a>?</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I understand the utility of voting. Though I was wondering if a distinction should be made between:</p>

<ul>
<li>off-topic question that should be deleted</li>
<li>off-topic question that should be moved to stackoverflow or statsexchange for instance</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that one can notify the admins by reporting the post, but should they be downvoting as well if the question is relevant but sadly on the wrong channel and ought to be migrated?</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>In general I would say that just because it needs to be migrated, is not a reason to downvote.</p>

<p>One of the ways to approach the question of <em>Should I downvote</em>, is to look at the text from the downvote button tooltip:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0LEux.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0LEux.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<hr>

<p>So, a question that is merely off-topic does not fit into this description.  This also means that the other reason you stated: <em>off topic that should be deleted</em> is likely also not be a reason for downvoting.  If a question is merely off-topic, the proper response, as Sean said in his comment, is to flag/vote to close.</p>

<p>If the question is good, but should be someplace else, then you can flag the moderator to migrate.             </p>

<p>One important note: if you are going to flag for migration, try to be sure that the question will be on-topic at the suggested destination.  A poorly written question will off-topic everywhere.</p>

<p>All sites in the network have a page at <em>/help/on-topic</em> to try and describe what is expected at that site.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>https://{sitename}.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic
</code></pre>

<p>So to summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>A well written, interesting, on-topic question should be upvoted.</li>
<li>A question that is poorly written should be downvoted.</li>
<li>A question that is off-topic should be flagged/voted for closure.</li>
<li>If the off-topic question would be good on another site, then flag for migration.</li>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>This is a great question!  Thanks for bringing it to meta.</p>
<h3>Question(s):</h3>
<p>I am going to summarize your question into two major points.</p>
<ol>
<li>Should we try to avoid creation of tags if another tag will work?</li>
<li>How aggressively should we curate tags?</li>
</ol>
<h3>TL;DR:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Yes, if you are contributing content, then try to avoid creation of tags if another tag will work.</li>
<li>You should not <em>aggressively</em> curate tags.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I put in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TL;DR</a> because I am afraid I will be somewhat long winded here.  Please bear with me while I do some exposition to build context, and hopefully establish <em>why</em> I think the above is true.</p>
<h3>Who needs to find the questions via tags?</h3>
<p>Primarily answerers.  Non-answerers are most likely to find the the questions and answers they are looking for via a web search engine.  But answerers, the bread and butter of stack exchange, will often follow tags to help find questions to answer.  So removing a superfluous minor tag is not nearly as important as getting an appropriate tag affixed.  For the same reason, an incorrect tag, should be removed so as not to provide a false positive to those same answerers.</p>
<h3>Things to be aware of when editing:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Edits without the edit privilege (suggested edits) require someone else’s attention.  One of the reject reasons for suggested edits is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>no improvement whatsoever</strong> This edit does not make the post even a little bit easier to read, easier to find, more accurate or more accessible. Changes are either completely superfluous or actively harm readability.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Edits drive posts to the front page.</p>
<p>So while edits are good, annoying answerers with a lot of churn on the front page is not good.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two things mean;</p>
<h3>Try to make your edits count</h3>
<p>Generally try to fix any problems with the post when you are editing it.  This is especially relevant if you come to the post to edit the tags. Don't simply replace a tag and move on. Take a moment to cleanup anything else that the posts needs.</p>
<p>On sites in which I have the edit privilege, I will freely make very small edits to new posts, but as the post ages, will need to see a better reason than something small. But this also means that for posts that have been recently answered, or had other activity that drives them to the front page, I might then take the time to fix smaller things, since they have already been bumped.</p>
<h3>Why tags as an organizing tool?</h3>
<p>Tags are very flexible and easy for the user to use. They are easily created in a distributed fashion, and have been shown to generally converge toward consistent meaning within a community.</p>
<p>There are however a couple of disadvantages, from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)#Advantages_and_disadvantages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<p>... the resulting metadata can include <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">homonyms</a> (the same tags used with different meanings) and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">synonyms</a> (multiple tags for the same concept), which may lead to inappropriate connections between items and inefficient searches for information about a subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Synonyms</h3>
<p>Jeff Atwood had a blog post a few years back describing the Whys and Whats of the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/08/01/tag-folksonomy-and-tag-synonyms/"">tag synonym system</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/suggest-tag-synonyms"">official page</a> has this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users with more than 1250 reputation and a total answer score of 5 or more on the tag, can suggest tag synonyms. Users with a total answer score (total upvotes minus total downvotes) of 5 or more on the tag, can vote for tag synonyms. Suggestions will be automatically approved when they reach a score of 4, and automatically deleted when they reach a score of -2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can suggest <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/suggest-tag-synonyms"">tag synonyms</a> at 1250 reputation (2500 on graduated sites) if you have an answer score of at least 5 in the tag.  But we don't have a lot of users that meet this criteria, so to date this has been a moderator (Sean) activity.</p>
<h3>When to use Meta?</h3>
<p>Meta is about giving the community a place to ask and answer question about the site.  Via voting on these things, it gives the community an opportunity to weigh in on things.</p>
<p>Meta questions on SO for tags are really about largely deployed tags, when they need to be made more specific or maybe have attracted lots of misuse so should be edited out and then have the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/03/24/redesigned-tags-page/"">tag wiki</a> give advice on what the tags should be used or for...</p>
<p>Homonyms, once they get to be a big enough problem, should likely be dealt with in Meta.  These sorts of discussions would likely benefit from the community getting a chance to weigh in on how best to deal with it.</p>
<h3>One more thought about removing small tags.</h3>
<p>I personally think trying to remove small tags (that are not obviously in error) that have been used more than a few times, is fighting against the tide.  Some things to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>All tags started with a list of 1 post.</li>
<li>Someone thought the tag relevent (someone else may also).</li>
<li>Since we are somewhat catering to answerers, and they are following tags, small use tags are likely not a big enough problem to warrant editing a post.</li>
</ol>

7,"<p>According to my scope of the subjects. Artificial intelligence in a very strict sense should only contain questions pertaining to how we can create truly intelligent (creative, aware, etc.) machines. Whereas data science is directly the manipulation of data in order to produce tools to make something better (image detection, intrusion detection, etc.). The separation is very blurry and I do not think that intelligence can exist without information/data, and its manipulations. However, most machine learning and deep learning demonstrated are simply conducting complex function approximations.</p>

<p>However, due to the popularization of machine learning and especially deep learning, the manipulation of data has created the impression of intelligent machine due to it being capable of competing with human performance in very targeted tasks (object recognition, segmentation, etc.). Evidently, the name artificial intelligence catches people's attention much more than data science or machine learning. Thus, it is common for news which is essentially generic data science/machine learning to be called artificial intelligence. </p>

<p>This is further demonstrated on the Artificial Intelligence site where the majority of the questions are pertaining more to data science and machine learning than truly discussing possibilities, methods or emerging work pertaining to machines capable of intelligence.</p>

7,"<p>This site graduated last year, and so as we're rounding out to the end of our first month of the new year, we'll be starting Community Promotion Ads for this site!</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>interesting blogs and resources related to data science</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2353"">here</a>.</p>

<p>In case of Cross Posts that I run across, I like to leave a comment for the OP explaining that cross-posting is heavily discouraged.  They often just don't know the policy.  </p>

7,"<p>First, to review the definitions from Wikipedia.</p>

<p><strong>DevOps</strong> - DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops). The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction [..]. DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, and more dependable releases, in close alignment with business objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Data Science</strong> - Data science is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured [..].</p>

<p>Now let's consider two cases. </p>

<p><strong>A. DevOps for Data Science</strong>: use DevOps knowledge base to deliver shorter cycles in data science experiments, more automation and scalability as well as reproducible experiments. Business case: ""works on my machine"" is a known problem also in data science teams and transition from first experiments to production is not always easy.</p>

<p><strong>B. Data Science for DevOps</strong>: use Data Science knowledge base to define and implement the vague ""Measure"" in DevOps principles. Using Industry 4.0 approach, you could evaluate data from the whole toolchain. Of course companies collect and analyse time series data, but afaik this is much more focused on production, or limited to the scope of separate tools. Business case: holistic data driven insights - not replacing but augmenting human interaction - in large scales environments (think of dozens of scrum teams and hundreds, even thousands of [micro]services).</p>

<p>Now my questions (please try to judge in terms of Q&amp;A community strategy):</p>

<li>Are A, B both more or less offtopic here or only one of them?</li>
<li>Would you recommend proposing a separate community for either A,B or both?</li>

<p>Is it a right take to flag a question on the above basis at the current time?</p>

<p>Many of these sorts of questions would require a book to answer.  These questions will be <em>Too Broad</em> and you should should consider if a Vote-To-Close would be appropriate.  From the <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/closed-questions"">help section</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if your question could be answered by an entire book, or has many valid answers (but no way to determine which - if any - are correct), then it is probably too broad for our format</p>
<p>... limit it to a specific problem with enough detail to identify an adequate answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, that unless a moderator votes, it takes 5 community members to close a question. So your close vote (flag), is just getting the process started. If you feel the question is Too Broad, then a Vote-To-Close is the right course of action.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would suggest the friendliest gesture would be to leave a comment explaining the above.  And if desired, give some tips on improving the question.

<p>These are generally closed as 'primarily opinion-based' if they're really just asking what the best site is.</p>

<p>If such a question has upvotes and useful answers, I'll usually convert it to a wiki. If people are getting value from it I'd rather go ahead and make an exception.</p>

7,"<p>A question about jokes was recently asked.  It is (IMHO) about as far off topic as you can get.  It took almost three days to close it and in the mean time it garnered 11 answers.</p>

<p>So, questions:</p>

<li><p>Is a joke question actually on-topic and I just don't understand what we are trying to do here?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming a joke question is severely off-topic, does taking 3 days to close mean the quantity and frequency of moderation is lacking?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming the answers are NO and YES, then I posit that we need more, and more involved, moderators. As of this edit, our four moderators last visited 4, 13, 126 &amp; 948 days ago.</p>

<p>A <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2383/why-does-it-take-so-long-to-attend-flags"">related question</a> was asked a few months ago.  The situation described there remains.</p>

7,"<p><a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/42621/11097"">This post</a> does not adhere to SO's standards. However, I don't see this as offensive or rude.</p>

<p>So, I have converted this to a community wiki, as there is no one answer to this post, and all the answers are relevant. </p>

<p>However, I will leave it to the community to decide whether it deserves to be closed down or not. </p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>The post is off-topic, to me. </p>

<p>However, this is a community too, where moderators try to implement what people want this SE to be (which is usually: on-topic and free of poor content). If a bunch of people want to answer this, I think it's less harmful to make the rare exception and not cut this off. I'd rather have an SE that allows maybe <em>one</em> joke post here and there that entertains 27 people, weighed against what must honestly be a really minor inconvenience for anyone else. It should be a wiki, and I've made a few popular ""What are the best X?"" posts wikis if they had a lot of decent discussion. That's what has been done and I agree with it.</p>

<p>Do we need more moderators? yes please. I have never been clear how we even call an election. The post you cite, however, is evidence of mods doing the right thing. The other post you cite seemed to expect a mod to answer flags in less than a day, which is nice I guess but hardly fatal for an SE at this scale. A week? maybe. But yes we need more mods to share the load.</p>

<p>What is harmful, in comparison, is the tone of the post here and your comments. This is not a constructive way to tell someone a post is off-topic, even when that's objectively true. We don't want people here, let alone mods, doing that. I think Dawny33's replies and actions are patient and reasonable, but you veer into ad hominem when questioning whether this person is doing their job, contributing enough.</p>

<p>Stepping back, this simply is not a big enough deal to escalate like this, even if you disagree. I'd agree we need more mods, but we need mods who will handle it more like Dawny33, not what you seem to want to happen here.</p>

<p>Let's leave it open as a wiki as exceptional, enjoy it, ignore it, move on, and keep it clean and light here.</p>

7,"<p>It seems like code prettifying is not enabled for this SE. I came across <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/25029/custom-loss-function-with-additional-parameter-in-keras"">this question</a> and thought that the lack of syntax highlighting might just be because no default highlighter is defined for <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keras"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;keras&#39;"" rel=""tag"">keras</a> or <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;tensorflow&#39;"" rel=""tag"">tensorflow</a> (happened on SO once upon a time). I then went to edit it and tried adding the following highlighting tags to no effect:</p>

<pre><code># At the top of the document
&lt;!-- language-all: python --&gt;
&lt;!-- language-all: py --&gt;  # pretty sure this isn't a valid tag
&lt;!-- language-all: lang-default --&gt;

# At the top of a single code block
&lt;!-- language: python --&gt;
&lt;!-- language: lang-default --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If code prettifying isn't enabled across the SE, could we get it enabled? I realize this isn't an SE specifically for coding questions, but often a little code helps to explain a question succinctly, and having syntax highlighting makes code so much easier to read.</p>

<p>If it's just an issue with these tags, could we add the <code>lang-default</code> highlighter to the <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keras"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;keras&#39;"" rel=""tag"">keras</a> and <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;tensorflow&#39;"" rel=""tag"">tensorflow</a> tags?</p>

7,"<p>This is my first time posting on meta so please excuse my question/comment if it needs to be changed in any way.</p>

<p>I am a regular user of SE Data Science but recently have discovered that a lot of questions on the ""Orange"" (Data Mining) tag are being closed for being off topic. When I read over some of these questions, to me at least, some seem like they would fit well on the platform.</p>

<p>Data Science is a very broad topic which I think in some cases can include topics like finding data, data mining, and visualization. I know other sites exist (like Open Data) but should topics like data mining and visualization be included in the list of acceptable questions listed on the site?</p>

<p>Would it help to add a page that provides a list of acceptable topics to ask on the site?</p>

<p>I found some similarity with a question that was recently asked here:
<a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2386/what-is-on-topic-here"">What is on-topic here?</a> </p>

<p>There is a lot to unpack here but it was just something that I noticed.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>What's an example of a question you would or would not consider on topic here that has been closed or left open? Usually programming questions are moved to SO even if about things like numpy or R. I imagine some data mining questions fall into that category</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>As I understand, Orange questions are within the scope of this site as long as there is a good explanation and it's related in some way to data science. The Orange tag has had 9 questions asked this month and 72 this year so people see value in said questions, most of which have answers and <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/43029/bioinformatics-add-on"">only one</a> was closed this month (probably two in the future). The closed question was ""why is there no volcano plot in the new version of Orange"" which is really not relevant to the site / low effort question.</p>

<p>About data mining (16 asked this month, 252 this year), the way I see it is that the tag and questions are relevant to the data science site because oftentimes we are facing doubts about the results and one of the main questions is: ""Maybe I messed up something when I was gathering the data"", or <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/22045/orange-changes-the-data-type"">even problems related to the format</a> questions that people see as relevant on this site given the answers given on said questions. General API or scrapping questions shouldn't belong to data science, something like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53973423/getting-value-after-button-click-with-beautifulsoup-python"">general BeautifulSoup questions</a> or <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6456304/scrapy-unit-testing"">general Scrapy questions</a>.</p>

<p>Open data is mostly for data source requests so data mining and code don't really belong there. I guess questions about the correct use of APIs would be relevant there as well as on Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>Programming questions should follow the same approach in my opinion. Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Keras, etc. are the most commonly used libraries in data science and there will be naturally questions related to them. As long as the question is related to a problem in: processing data, training-testing models, visualization of data and models, storing models and data, ensembles, etc. they should be seen as on-topic. This can be exemplified by: <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/40477/keras-sequential-cnn-for-image-data-reshaping-data-issues"">keras Sequential CNN for image data reshaping data issues</a> here a question about how code is directly related to a problem in CNNs and reshaping of data (pre-processing). R is mostly used for data science, ML and statistics and not for much more so it's hard to find an unrelated question in R in my opinion.</p>

<p>What I think it is an interesting proposal for expansion in my opinion are questions about <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/43003/keras-neural-network-entirely-different-results-on-two-different-hardwares-one/43019#43019"">doing data science in the cloud</a>, like, in AWS instances or VPSs. My guess is that more and more people will find problems specific to the use of cloud services and still will be related to data science. </p>

7,"<p>2019 is here! And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of <strong>Community Promotion Ads</strong>! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>interesting blogs and resources related to data science</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2408"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I think, we have all probably seen some variation of this question. I found myself commenting the other day on a post like this with ""For clarification - have you worked with Tensorflow before or are you familiar with LSTM architecture?"" To which the response was silent.</p>

<p>My question is, how should we as community members address these types of questions going forward? It seems like there is a small amount of people who take to the site to ask for help with their ideas but have no prior experience with coding or ML.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>Agree, these just aren't a good fit for SE sites and should be closed as too broad or unclear. If someone is truly that new to even how to frame a question about data science, I don't think an SE site is the place to learn. If they do know and are just looking for ideas, it's not a good fit for the format. If they're just wanting someone to do the legwork to collect basic info and could do it themselves - we need to discourage it. </p>

Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post <em>one question per answer</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>If your question contains a link, please use the syntax of <code>[text](link)</code>, as that will make it easier for transcribing for the finished questionnaire.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at currently.</p></li>
<li><p>At the start of the nomination phase, the Community Team will select <strong>up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community</strong> provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election.</p></li>
<li><p>Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, typically containing 10 questions in total.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&amp;A.</p></li>

<p>Many people think that closing questions is harsh and should only be used in the most extreme cases.  Others think that closing questions that meet the closing guidelines is one of the main methods to keep question quality high.</p>

<p>I definitely think that a closing vote is unwelcoming. I am slow to use the close option because it just doesn't set a good tone for the community and will ultimately hinder our growth. I understand that this may result in some questions that will require extra moderation. But we have to accept the current state of the data science field and work with it, not against it. </p>

<p>I have been a member here for more than 2 years and I visit on a near daily basis. My participation has mostly been in (1) answering questions and providing help to new users and (2) helping out in the moderation cues, including the tag wikis (can you believe we didn't have a ""pip"" tag!?!? I added that). I will also add a question from time to time but nearly all of my reputation score is from helping others on this site. </p>

<p>I think that edits are a double-edged sword. While this site is in English and many users are based in the US, we cannot allow ourselves to have a narrow view. Quite frankly, some of the edits that I see in the cues are disrespectful to non-English speakers. So, I think that editing requires a measured approach with the understanding that data science has people from diverse backgrounds working in the field.</p>

<p>I would give them increased responsibility on the site. The responsibility for this site also brings accountability and focus. If the knowledge of the user really helps the site, then the answer isn't to admonish them, the answer is to create more accountability so that their actions can help the site in a positive manner. </p>

<p>I would encourage all mods to close questions only under the most extreme circumstances. Closing questions leaves a ""bad taste in the mouth"" and that is a user that we are unlikely to get to participate again. Be friendly, be helpful, be an active participant - closing a question is an act from a non-participant, a passive member of the site, which a moderator cannot be. </p>

<p>I will freely take credit for starting the trend of people starting posts to newbies with ""Welcome to the site!"". I started doing that last year because I want to be helpful and all of us were once new to data science. So I like that others are using that same greeting now and anybody that chooses to start their post with that is amazing!</p>

<p>What is a low quality question? There really is no single way to quantify that. But we can certainly quantify how many people we lose with an unwelcoming reply to questions and we simply can't allow that to continue or this site will never grow. </p>

<p>I disagree with the premise that we need guidelines for this. I think that those items will take care of themselves over the long term with any number of factors coming into play. For example, the AI SE is sponsored by IBM - in other words, that SE isn't going anywhere. There's simply too many items in play for any single person to do something about it. The only thing I can focus on is making Data Science the best SE possible and everything else will take care of itself in the long run. </p>

<p>Moderators provide a combination of representation, leadership, mentoring, guidance and overall help. Yes, of course I'm willing to participate in the editing cues, just as I always have. But if a moderator isn't willing to accept the added roles that come with being selected then this site just isn't being properly served. I'm willing to be one of the leaders that will make this site grow as much as it can.</p>

<p>I fully support removing posts from the site through the use of close votes. For posts that blatantly display a lack of refined effort, clarity, or do not follow the guidelines for asking thoughtful questions, I believe immediate closure is appropriate. I also believe however, that users that make questions of salvageable quality should be encouraged to make edits and improvements or be put on hold (see my recent Meta comment about this). Overall, I would continue to vote to close posts which clearly stand out as unacceptable, but would leave others open to encourage improvement or to the discretion of democratic vote from other reviewers.</p>

<p>Since this question seemed to place an emphasis on a quantitative component to this answer, I did the following calculations on my recent voting history for convenience:</p>

<p>7% were Leave Open votes</p>

<p>30% were Skip Post votes</p>

<p>63% were Close votes</p>

<p>Ultimately, most questions that populate the close queue arrived for a legitimate reason. So I don't see these statistics changing that much with moderator privileges, however, perhaps less closure votes.</p>

<p>I visit the Stack Exchange Data Science site frequently. Generally, at least once a day but sometimes up to three times a day. I also visit Stack Overflow as well just less frequently.

<p>As my comment explains above, to me, editing is more defined and less of a grey area. Either a question is exemplary in its spelling, phrasing, and clarity or not. Overall, I enjoy editing posts. In the last quarter, I edited 34 posts (I think this is a fairly significant number relative to the size of our site and frequency of new questions asked). I would edit more posts with immediate edit privilege.</p>

<p>While thoughtful answers prove invaluable to the success of our site, they should not come at the expense of our basic Code of Conduct. Ultimately, everyone represents the site - especially those with high reputation. In this case, I would talk to the user privately to try to resolve the issue or at least discuss it in a preliminary attempt to resolve the issue amicably. If displays of rudeness or repeated flagging persisted, I would suggest enacting a temporary ban to further convey the importance of respectful behavior.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the moderators of a Stack Exchange forum all share unique expertise related to their respective forum. If a moderator decided to close a post that I disagreed with, I would respect their decision to do so. I would however, seek clarification as to why it was closed so that I could make any necessary edits or understand why the particular question was closed. Ultimately, moderators should trust the judgment of their peers but sometimes mistakes can happen. </p>

<p>Since gaining access to the review queues, I have been very active in them. Most frequently, I review posts in the close votes queue and the first post queue as these are often the most pressing to address in a timely manner. I also occasionally frequent the open vote queue and the late post queue, although admittedly, less than the other two. If there are any users which seem like they may be interested in participating in review tasks I would actively encourage them to explore them. Users who recently cross the reputation eligibility thresholds may also not be familiar with their access to the review sections; therefore, I would make sure to let them know about this feature.</p>

<p>It is difficult to pick a definitive favorite for a post/answer on this site however, two that stood out to me were the following:</p>

<p>This recent <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/47267/what-is-the-most-efficient-method-for-hyperparameter-optimization-in-scikit-lear"">question</a> by Brian. I like this question because it is clearly very well thought out. It also adds an explanatory preface, acknowledges current progress, and clearly states the question. Further, it asks for working code examples and benchmarks which could be useful to future readers.</p>

<p>I also like the top answer <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/6107/what-are-deconvolutional-layers"">here</a> because it has very clear visualizations. Sometimes answers can be best expressed in pictures, animations, or formulas rather than always in text format. To me, answers which utilize each when appropriate greatly enhance their overall effectiveness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""8"">
  <li>How do you ensure a community welcoming to new users while preventing a high number of low-quality questions?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The best way to preserve a well maintained and welcoming community is to help new users learn how to craft high quality questions while simultaneously filtering out low quality questions. I believe that leaving comments like ""welcome to Stack Exchange Data Science, please consider adding more content to help better explain your question"" can be helpful for new users; but, for questions which are not appropriate for the site, even coming from a new user, they should be removed. This answer shares some similarity to Question 1.</p>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>While this site is similar in structure to other sites like Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange Data Science is unique in that it is much less developed. As a result, I believe that moderation for our site in particular, should be centered around fostering the growth and development of a community focused on generating exceptionally high quality content. Overall, this should be its largest distinguishing factor. I am not an expert on the specific protocol for Cross Validated, but to me, its has always seemed to be more focused on mathematical and statistical explanations to particular machine learning topics rather than broader conceptual explanations. Additionally, just from browsing its top tags, in comparison, it seems to place a greater emphasis on the use of regression based techniques and models.</p>

<p>Moderators uphold basic organization of a site in addition to mediating conflict. They should also act as leaders on the site. Beyond the tasks outlined in the elections post, moderators also work to maintain administrative aspects of the site such as review queues and cleanliness. They also act to be community leaders and ultimately lead by example.</p>

<li>If not, I would suggest edits which can make the question salvageable and leave it to the OP to accept or reject the edits. If they reject, then the question would be closed down. So, I believe in giving a chance for posts with salvageable quality.</li>

<p>My health has not been great throughout the last quarter, which didn't allow me a lot of internet time. However, I haven't seen any clogs or blockages in the review queues.

<p>I keep receiving 'unhelpful' or 'abusive' flags by new users against active users, once in a while. In most such occasions, it was when an active user gives suggestions like:  'Please go read the theory before trying to implementing' (which I concur 'cause with the hype of ML and data science, new comers tend to dive into implementation before understanding theory, which isn't very helpful for them), so very few such flags were held valid in our site's history, which again speaks for the welcoming nature of our site. </p>

<p>I understand that some feel closing questions is unwelcoming, in particular because a lot of first time questions are subject to close votes. However, I think it is important that low quality questions are closed consistently and also quickly. For first time questions, I try to leave comments that explain the reasoning or could help reopen the question. </p>

<p>Most questions that get closed are either too broad or are not well researched. I think it is now accepted among most active users that these questions should be closed, see e.g. <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2414/23305"">here</a>, and I think it is important to remain consistent. </p>

<p>Other questions are just very simple and could be quickly resolved by an online search.

<p>I prefer to think that there are two paths: (1) putting a question on hold temporarily; (2) closing a question.</p>

<p>The goal of putting a question on hold is not to shut it down forever, but to put it on pause to give the poster a chance to address feedback or clarify the question.  I think that many questions can be handled through this path.  In particular, the path I see is to put a question on hold, and leave a comment explaining how the question can be improved and that the decision can be reconsidered once the feedback is addressed.  The idea is to give the poster guidance on how to make their question suitable and share our community's norms and expectations.  Assuming the original poster returns to revise their question, it can be re-opened once it is clarified.  So the goal and hope is that this leads to a question that is ultimately open, not closed.</p>

<p>Closing a question is necessary in some cases, where no amount of changes can make the question suitable -- e.g., where it is simply off-topic.  But my experience is that the majority of cases are better handled by the ""on hold"" process.</p>

<p>I think we can put questions on hold while being welcoming.  There is some data to suggest that one of the most discouraging responses is radio silence, where the poster receives no response or engagement.  I suspect constructive feedback is far better than silence.</p>

<p>So, in short, I suspect some of the discontent about closing questions can be addressed by using the ""on hold"" process.  Of course, the underlying mechanism we have (vote to close) may look the same for both, but we can explain the difference in comments.</p>

<p>I expect that I'd only use moderator powers to close a question unilaterally when I am sure it is unsuitable.  Otherwise, I'd leave a comment (e.g., ""this looks like it might be too broad to fit our site format; any community votes?"").</p>

<p>This requires looking at the nature of the arguments and flags.  If the user is rude or violating our be nice rules, they need a mod message or suspension explaining our requirements to participate on the site; those rules are mandatory, and producing a steady stream of valuable answers does not provide a ""get out of jail"" card.

7,"<h3>Disclaimer 1: There were other questions related to the broad nature of our help-center in regard to what is on-topic, none of them have a good or clearly answer, in my opinion.</h3>

<p>Data Science in its nature is a broad subject with applications ranging from <strong>NLP</strong> and <strong>Computer Vision</strong> to <strong>Predicting Stock Prices</strong> and <strong>Future Revenue</strong>, so it is quite difficult to pin-point what is and what is not on topic as basically anything can benefit from Data Science techniques.</p>

<p>Images are 2D Digital Signals, and Image Processing is clearly a subtopic of <a href=""https://dsp.stackexchange.com/"">Signal Processing SE</a> but with relevant influence on <strong>Computer Vision</strong> which is one of the most successful <strong>Deep Learning Application</strong>.</p>

<p>As basically anything can be related to DS and as the help center is pretty broad about what is on-topic on DS SE how should people define where to ask?</p>

<p>See for example <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/27286/what-does-energy-in-image-processing-mean"">this question</a> from Dawny33♦, a high reputation and clearly an important member of our community:</p>

<ul>
<li>The question is: <strong>What does 'energy' in image processing mean?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It points to a Data Science related article <a href=""https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa16/hw/proj4-seamcarving/imret.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing</a>, but the question itself is purely about image processing, a subset of Digital Signal Processing.</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/"">Cross Validated</a> covers machine learning models them selves and <a href=""https://dsp.stackexchange.com/"">Signal Processing</a> covers things like digital image processing it would be on-topic to have pure machine learning or pure digital image processing question on Data Science Stack Exchange?</p>

<p>Or should we accept this kind of question once Data Scientist themselves are problem solvers and might have to tackle outside their field of expertise to solve Data Science problems without the need to contextualize the subject inside Data Science? (One can ask about DIP to understand it in order to later apply that to a DS system)</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>My immediate instinct is to suggest that image processing be off-topic.  Why?  It seems pretty far afield from data science to me.  Also, it seems adequately covered on other sites (both Stack Overflow and Signal Processing).</p>

<p>In contrast, applications of machine learning to computer vision should be on-topic.</p>

<hr>

<p>A different way to consider it would be: Does the question need to be answered from a data science perspective?   Would data scientists have unique expertise to answer it, that isn't available in other communities?  Or, is the question of unique relevance and interest to data scientists?  If the answers are yes, then it seems suitable here.  However, a random question about image processing typically isn't something that needs to be answered from a data science perspective and so wouldn't fall into that category.</p>

<li>Can we create featured topic where we can propose definitions for on-topic and off-topic questions on meta and use the voting process to decide ""on-topicity""?

7,"<p>To answer your question, we must ask: what is the point of the ""accepted"" answer?</p>

<p>You are asking for more reasons to allow somebody (who that someone is exactly, is to be determined) to anoint an answer as ""accepted"".  But to what end?  IE: Why?  What is the supposed benefit, of someone beside the OP, choosing an accepted answer?</p>

<p>In general, the ""best"" answer should be the one with the most votes.  The ""accepted"" answer is really just an opportunity for the asker, to get a special privilege of promoting a specific answer.  If the asker does not care to exercise that privilege, then why should we care?  What would be the benefit of giving another anointed group a special privilege?</p>

<p>I disagree that we should have a special group, that gets special privileges, to choose special answers..</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question of best practices and best ways to visualize certain kind of data. Example:</strong>

<ul>
<li>I would like to produce a infographic on the 'Brexit' referendum. Given public opinion data across the UK, what are some meaningful techniques to visualize it in a dashboard?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Field Specific information with direct relation to Data Science:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Questions of field understanding that can be used for modeling. Example:</strong>

<h3>Questions on Data Science</h3>

<ul>
<li>Career related, definitions and interpretations of terms in Data Science</li>
</ul>

<h2>For off-topic questions</h2>

<p>If your question is not specifically on-topic for Data Science Stack Exchange, it may be on topic for another Stack Exchange site. For example, questions here are frequently also suitable, or more suitable, on one of:</p>

7,"<p>I understand that for question asking, if quality is low or it looks like there was not sufficient effort or time put into asking a question it can be downvoted.</p>

<p>My question is: why is there a penalty for downvoting answers? Shouldn't they be under the same scrutiny and review of the community at large? I feel like sometimes people answer questions which either do not fully address the question or are misleading or inaccurate. In this case, once an answer has already been provided, the question is less likely to receive a different answer to improve upon it.</p>

<p>I feel like by penalizing downvotes we are discouraging people from holding answers to higher standards. Also, why can comments not be downvoted?</p>

<p>Interested to hear you guys thoughts on this.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>What about allowing downvotes without any penalty to both the issuer and the person who answered the question? Would just seeing a downvote discourage users to post answers?</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>The logic (outlined a bit in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/06/13/optimizing-for-pearls-not-sand/"">this blog post</a>) is basically as follows:</p>
<p>SE values answers more than questions. That's why there is no penalty for downvoting questions (and less reputation gain for question upvotes than answers).</p>
<p>A bad question is considered more harmful than a bad answer because it diminishes the overall appeal of the site. Similarly a good answer is valued more than a good question because it is easier to ask a good question than to give a good answer.</p>
<p>The small penalty is meant to make you consider carefully which answers to downvote in order <em>not to discourage other people from answering</em>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, you are encouraged to downvote in some cases, in particular:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use your downvotes whenever you encounter an egregiously sloppy,
no-effort-expended post, or an answer that is clearly and perhaps
dangerously incorrect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But more importantly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are the alternatives to downvoting?</strong></p>
<p>The upvote privilege comes
first because that's what you should focus on: pushing great content
to the top. Downvoting should be reserved for extreme cases. It's not
meant as a substitute for communication and editing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, we would like to see more answers and that the good/great ones raise to the top via upvotes. The worse ones should be improved by the community if possible through edits (and, more limited, comments). Downvotes are reserved for the hopefully few remaining answers.</p>
<p>Comments are not meant for answering questions and therefore there is not much need for downvoting. Instead you can <em>flag</em> comments that are rude or spam (as you are encouraged to flag answers that don't meet our standards).</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>One of the reasons for the cost to down vote answers, is to discourage answer-er's from down voting other answers, simply to move their answer to the top.</p>

<p>Data Science does not have so much traffic that competitive answering is a problem that really needs addressing, (wouldn't that be great?)  But on Stack Overflow, the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/18014/347908"">FGITW &amp; SCITE</a> can be a problem.</p>

7,"<p>I've been discovering DataScienceSE for about two months and although I kind of like the topic, my impression is that this SE is not doing great. I've been active on a few other SE sites for some time and one can really tell the difference. Apparently there's just not enough regular active members for the flow of questions (<a href=""https://stackexchange.com/sites#technology"">68% answered</a>). Crucially there are very few votes being cast, and this is quite bad given that the SE model relies on votes.</p>

<p>To illustrate my point: I gave 50 answers in the past two months, half of which have zero votes. In average I collected probably around 0.5 votes per answer (not counting OP's choice; without any negative vote as far as I know).

<p>Why do you say ""of course"" not very welcoming?  Why do you feel welcoming is a key here?  Why should anyone be welcome to put up anything they want, and be welcomed for it?

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I guess we can only speculate about the reasons. This site is more ""practical"" than crossvalidation. So questions necessarily are relevant to a smaller audience. And we have a lot of ""beginner"" questions that sometimes feel repetitive. </p>

<p>One simple, practical thing I'd recommend is this: If you go through the ""First Posts"" (and we have a lot of first posts) and ""Late Answers"" review queue and you see a good/on-topic question/answer instead of simply clicking ""No Action Needed"" upvote and click ""I'm done"". Just as quick.</p>

<p>Another is making edits to questions with uninformative titles (like ""quick question about classification"" or whatever) so people know what it is about and attract more traffic.</p>

7,"<blockquote>
  <p>Why so few people vote? Is it because there are not enough ""avid members"", too much turn-over, too many questions, questions being too specialized (or not enough)... ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it has more to do with the questioners. I haven't been here long, but I suspect many people make an account to ask one question related to a school project or something. When they don't get a quick answer <em>or even if they do</em>, they never return or bother to upvote/accept. (This is why I don't usually answer calculus homework questions on the math SE). In other words, they're not interested in contributing (voting, asking, answering). For people interested in contributing, this may be frustrating and drive them away. All SE sites have many such people, but the ratio must be small for anything to work, I think. </p>

<p>Another answerer mentioned practicality, but I would have expected that to actually be helpful in terms of motivating people to participate, though many such problems can be quite localized, which may be what he/she meant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What can be done about it? (if anything)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For sure, more voting would be nice (at least for me, I'll probably give up contributing without that improving). It's ok if questions are basic I think (I have basic questions too), but at least they should be interesting and <em>well-written</em> (grammatically, syntactically, coherence-wise, and semantically), which often isn't happening. I am not generally ""harsh"" on questioners and want to be helpful to beginners, but if they can't even take the time to formulate a well-written complete question with context and details in proper English, then why should anyone take the time to answer it? Sometimes I answer these anyway if the underlying question is ok, and don't even get a +1 or any response hahaha. Then again maybe my answers aren't good.</p>

<p>I think this site is quite different than cross-validated (which I expect to be more theoretical), but I actually don't really know the difference between this site and the AI SE. Maybe coordinating to better define the difference would help, since the overlap seems substantial.</p>

7,"<p>For the last several months, I spend some time once every while to improve the Tag Wiki of Data Science Site. In most of the cases, I look on other Stack Exchange sites if they have a decent Tag description and I use that one as well by adding/removing parts that not make sense or are poorly written.</p>

<p>Is this acceptable? Based on this Meta Stack Exchange question (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/330461/472666"">Copying (partially) tag wiki from one site to another. Attribution and best practices?</a>), <strong>Yes, it is.</strong> </p>

<p>Not adding an attribution is a reason to reject a suggestion? <strong>No. You don't have to.</strong> StackExchange is based on Creative Commons. It is clearly mentioned here, in <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/faq/#how-do-i-properly-attribute-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">their official page</a>, that when you share content inside the company or organisation you don't need to add any attribution at all.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: This is not about the Rejected Tag Wiki, but a mean to prove that what happened acts against the friendly, collaborated environment that StackExchange tries to promote. Acting by own rules that don't follow common practices in SE and actions that push users away from being active.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>During the last time, I got many of them rejected, while in my honest opinion, it shouldn't. Here is an example</p>

<p><strong>Tag:</strong> Seaborn (no description before)</p>

<p><strong>Short Description</strong></p>

<p>Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. Its primary goal is to provide a concise, high-level interface for drawing statistical graphics that are both informative and attractive.</p>

<p><strong>Rejection reason</strong></p>

<p>Simply defining what a [tag] is rarely helps those using it unless the tag's name itself is ambiguous. Excerpts should describe why and when a tag should be used. See the help center for more guidance.</p>

<p><strong>Long Description</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/330461/472666"">Seaborn</a> is a library for making attractive and informative statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of <code>matplotlib</code> and tightly integrated with the PyData stack, including support for <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code> data structures and statistical routines from <code>scipy</code> and <code>statsmodels</code>.</p>

<p>Some of the features that seaborn offers are</p>

<ul>
<li>Several built-in themes that change the default matplotlib aesthetics</li>
<li>Tools for choosing color palettes to make beautiful plots that reveal patterns in your data</li>
<li>Functions for visualizing univariate and bivariate distributions or for comparing them between subsets of data</li>
<li>Tools that fit and visualize linear regression models for different kinds of independent and dependent variables</li>
<li>A function to plot statistical timeseries data with flexible estimation and representation of uncertainty around the estimate</li>
<li>High-level abstractions for structuring grids of plots that let you easily build complex visualizations</li>
</ul>

<p>This tag should be used for seaborn related questions. Since seaborn heavily builds on top of matplotlib, and since many seaborn related problems can be come by using standard matplotlib techniques, it is advisable to additionally add the [matplotlib] tag to any seaborn question as well.</p>

<p><strong>Rejection Reason</strong></p>

<p>This edit copies a significant amount of content from an external source. Generic descriptions such as encyclopedia articles and ad copy do not provide useful guidance; try creating something useful to this community specifically, and be sure to attribute the original author. See: How to reference material written by others.</p>

<hr>

<p>Both of them are used in StackOverflow with about 3.500 questions and 9 revisions to end up to this tag version. I strongly believe that the quality of those was high enough to get accepted. If there were things that could be added to improve the proposed text, that could be another revision on top of that.</p>

<p>Most of the Tags I added were accepted by other users (based on the review history) but were rejected by one specific mod. The explanation that was given was against what the linked meta-question mentioned above and I am really confused about what we should/shouldn't do to improve this community in the end. </p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>The rejection reasons sound like valid criticisms to me. In particular, since this tag seems more relevant for StackOverflow, a description for this site should ideally point out when this tag should be used here specifically. Generic questions about <code>seaborn</code> are more on-topic on StackOverflow. Hence, a description should point out when it would make sense to use it here.</p>

<p>That being said, I don't feel very strongly about this because the tag didn't have any prior description and most other tag descriptions are <strong>unfortunately</strong> also very generic. In my opinion, any description is better than none. </p>

<p>However, it's not quite clear from your question if you added a similar attribution to what is shown in your reference, which says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The contents of this tag-wiki originates from ""julia"" tag-wiki description at Stack Overflow and was edited to reflect usage guidance and advice specific for the Computational Science community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that would be missing, that's certainly a problem.</p>

<p>I think we are all human here, moderators included, so I think both opinions are reasonable. Don't take these decisions too personal. Lastly, <strong>thank you</strong> for making an effort to improve the site! Please, keep it up!</p>
",DataSciencemeta

<h3>Attribution is needed:</h3>
<p>You state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I look on other Stack Exchange sites if they have a decent Tag description and I use that one as well by adding/removing parts that not make sense or are poorly written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this acceptable? Based on this Meta Stack Exchange question (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/330461/347908"">Copying (partially) tag wiki from one site to another. Attribution and best practices?</a>), <strong>Yes, it is.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you missed a <em>key</em> element from the question you cited, which was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the tag wiki, it is possible and probably necessary to give the proper attribution according to the <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CC BY-SA 3.0 license</a> requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Copying without attribution is <em>plagarism</em> and is forbidden network wide, not simply on the tag wiki.</p>
<h3>Customization is needed.</h3>
<p>Another reason to not simply copy tag wikis is given in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/309011/347908"">this answer</a> by the head of community moderation.</p>
<h3>Usage Guidance</h3>
<p>As for the Tag Excerpt Rejection Reason, you noted it to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply defining what a [tag] is rarely helps those using it unless the tag's name itself is ambiguous. Excerpts should describe why and when a tag should be used. See the help center for more guidance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rejection reason is in fact a canned response, and I think is relatively clear in its explanation of the problem.  But maybe your confusion comes from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the Tags I added were accepted by other users (based on the review history) but were rejected by one specific mod. The explanation that was given was against what the linked meta-question mentioned above and I am really confused about what we should/shouldn't do to improve this community in the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of notes on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>For anyone reading, I am the <em>specfic mod</em>.</li>
<li>Simply because the changes were accepted, does not make them correct.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Higher Standard</h3>
<p>Reviewing the tag wiki edits are at <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/277031/can-we-have-tag-wiki-and-wiki-excerpt-edit-reviews-in-a-separate-queue-to-sugges"">a higher standard</a> and require more reputation.  On Stack Overflow approving plagarized content can get the <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/318288/stopping-tag-wiki-plagiarism-part-ii-taking-action"">reviewer banned</a> from reviewing.  In addition, the larger site actually have review audits to help educate reviewers on site standards.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>After a long discussion I had with the moderator oW_ about the community status in Data Science Site, I decided to gather some ideas and propose them here.</p>

<p>Note: My personal view is that a moderator should act as an Ambassador. Someone who will be responsible to promote and activate the community. Not just accepting/rejecting questions. However, I fully understand that it is just my personal view and behaviour that one should not demand from local staff members.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the ideas now</p>

<h1>#1 Create useful content</h1>

<p>Even if this is the first one, it’s not the most important. We already have enough questions and answer, but it’s something we can do in parallel. When we have knowledge of something useful, but there isn’t any related question already on the site, we can ask it, wait for 2-3 days and if there isn’t any decent answer, post the answer ourselves. This is something we did in Open Data SE.</p>

<p>What we achieve with this: Improve Google Ranking of DS SE and increase the traffic to our site. </p>

<h1>#2 Reduce the number of unanswered questions</h1>

<p>If we all try to answer 1-2 questions from the unanswered list every week, we will manage to keep it low. </p>

<p>What we achieve with this: It’s not about the number, but make users feel that there will always be an answer for them. </p>

<h1>#3 Guides and Tutorials</h1>

<p>We can have community-wiki guides about specific parts of the daily routine in Data Science SE. It’s doesn’t have to be long, endless documentation. It can be in a format of QnA. For example, how should I judge if I should vote to close a question? Create a step by step guide of what a user must examine. Giving links to the Help section, adding screenshots and comments.</p>

<p>What we achieve with this: We help users to contribute to the site. We don’t let them find the right way themselves.</p>

<h1>#4 Special Days - Datathons</h1>

<p>We can schedule it that once every x months, we create a community event with a specific target. For example, we will try to answer all unanswered questions with that specific Tag. We promote it inside DS Site and outside in social media. We have an open call for anyone to participate.</p>

<p>What we achieve with this: Participation. Any user wants to feel that is part of a bigger community. Let them feel it. </p>

<h1>#5 Special Days - Self-promotions</h1>

<p>I think I saw it in the past in another Meta site. There is one special day every month where a user can promote a project related to Data Science in a meta question that started by a mod. It shouldn’t be a link promotion, but a short-medium post about how this project is related to DS. It’s not necessary that users will promote their own projects. They might do any interesting project they found. </p>

<p>What we achieve with this: We create an extra bond between users and DS Site. Also, they have an extra reason to visit Meta.</p>

<h1>#6 Chat rooms</h1>

<p>We don’t use chat rooms at all. We don’t have to do it when there is a long comment discussion. We could have different chart rooms for different generic subjects (about Data Science) and promote the discussion there as well.</p>

<p>What we achieve with this: We keep users more active during their session here</p>

<h1>#7 Site promotion</h1>

<p>I put this one last since it’s not something that anyone might want to do. Promotion of the Data Science SE in other places. Last February, I did promote the website in two big communities outside of Stack Exchange. I made it clear that the link is not an affiliate, I don’t have something to win from this and ask for specific actions. Here is a screenshot of one of the posts I did.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BUGgX.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BUGgX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I believe that the results of those two promotions were big enough. If we check the number of questions/answers during that period we can see a change in the trend.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWots.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWots.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Those were some of the ideas I have to improve this community that we all love. Please use the answers to either add feedback on those specific ideas or suggest another one that you like. It might be better if we decide to coordinate one of those, to do it through a chat room since it might need a longer discussion.</p>

<p>Let's ask ourselves <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/31776/347908"">why do we tag</a>?  If you follow that link, you will find (to my mind) that there are two primary benefits to tags.</p>

<li>The second most important reason for tagging (in my opinion) is to help others find the information they may need.</li>

<p>I would argue that the referenced question, while a great question, is narrow enough, that tagging it as specifically as suggested, is unlikely to help it find an answer-er, or help those needing the answer find the answer via the tag.  And thus, the suggested tag is not likely to be super beneficial.</p>

7,"<p>In the last few hours, I have raised four (4) flags in SO and five (5) flags in Data Science SE (DSSE), all of them concerning systematic plagiarism (and attempts of) by a specific user.</p>

<p>In brief:</p>

<ul>
<li>Said user sees an SO question, posts an exact copy to DSSE, gets an answer here, then comes back to SO and posts this answer word by word (including a clarification in the comments) without attribution; FWIW, he does not even bother to accept (or even upvote) the DSSE answer he plagiarizes, while he prompts the OP in SO to ""<em>tick my answer as correct</em>"" (and ends up with 3 upvotes).</li>
<li>User sees a DSSE question, posts an exact copy at SO, gets an answer, then comes back at DSSE and posts this answer again word by word without attribution. Again FWIW, and in contrast with the short answer of the previous bullet, this answer is a <em>long</em> and comprehensive one, including quotes and code snippets.</li>
<li>User sees a question in SO with a bounty of 50, posts an exact copy to DSSE without attribution, but unfortunately (!) he doesn't get any answers here, so the act stops here.</li>
<li>User does the exact same thing as in the last bullet above with <strong>three (3)</strong> more SO questions, this time without bounties; again, no answers here at DSSE, hence no further acts at SO.</li>
</ul>

<p>With one justifiable exception, all these flags here and at SO were found helpful and accepted.</p>

<p>The result?</p>

<ul>
<li>Here at DSSE, user gets only a <strong>temporal</strong> suspension for plagiarism for <strong>7 days</strong></li>
<li>At SO, <strong>nothing</strong>; user maintains his ~ 700 rep, and he is let loose to leave comments around, accusing me of ""<em>taking advantage of your reputation</em>""...</li>
</ul>

<p>So, to break down the question in the title:</p>

<ul>
<li>Isn't it clear that here we have a case of systematic, intentional, recurring, and planned plagiarism practice, aiming at gaining undeserved reputation across SE, which, had it gone unnoticed, could have gone on for who knows how long for? Or is it just my idea?</li>
<li>If yes, what more is needed in order to permanently suspend such a user?</li>
</ul>

<p>And to conclude, will I find myself eventually in the defensive, trying to complain for retaliation to people unwilling to listen?</p>

<p>Just asking... Because if I find myself in such a situation in the future, it would be obvious that I have done something <em>very</em> wrong...</p>

<p>I saw a question with the tag <code>k-nn</code> for K-Nearest Neighbors. I thought it was a typo and that it should be changed to <code>knn</code>. To my surprise, the <code>knn</code> tag didn't exist and isn't a synonym either.</p>

<p>I thought ""fair enough"" and wanted to add <code>knn</code> as a synonym for <code>k-nn</code> so that people like me would find it easier or would not try to create an unnecessary tag.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>I was unable to add a synonym for the tag because it requires a score of at least 5 in that tag. I then tried to add a synonym for a tag for which I did meet that requirement. It said that the synonym must have already been used in the site to be added.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>

<p>I feel that adding synonyms should be more accessible. The primary goal of tags is to filter questions in an efficient way. The enemies of this are:</p>

<ul>
<li>missing tags</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Currently, tags like <code>knn</code> or <code>automated-machine-learning</code> do not exist. If someone searches for them, they might think they need to add them to the site. Which leads to:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>redundant tags</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>If they don't know about <code>k-nn</code> and <code>automl</code> we will have redundant tags. To fix it, someone will need to point this out, and provide them as synonyms of each other.</p>

<p>On another note, they do not have usage guidelines. My assumption would be that a question tagged with <code>math</code> can be:</p>

<li>a question about a specific formula</li>
<li>a question requesting a mathematical answer (as opposed to intuitive)</li>

<p>I am a bit fuzzy about whether questions about papers are or should be considered on-topic. Maybe there is a distinction between:</p>

<ul>
<li>A specific question about a part of the paper (i.e., how should I interpret this equation?)</li>
<li>A general question about the paper (i.e. what dataset did they use? Is there an implementation? How to contact the author?)</li>
<li>A discussion question about the implication of the paper?</li>
</ul>

<p>I would assume that the first one is fine and that the others probably aren't.</p>

<p>Can anyone confirm?</p>

<p>A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>While there certainly are <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">Moderators</a> here, a significant amount of the <em>moderation</em> is done by ordinary people, using the privileges 
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.</p>

<p>As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together. 
And what could be more festive than a big pile of numbers? 
So here is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on Data Science over the past 12 months:</p>

<p>¹ ""Community"" here refers both to <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/users"">the membership of Data Science</a> <em>without</em> <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators"">diamonds next to their names</a>, and to the automated systems otherwise known as <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/users/-1"">user #-1</a>.</p>

<p>² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.</p>

<p>³ A ""destroyed"" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>

<p>⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>

<p>⁵ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes).</p>

<p>⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>

<p>⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   </p>

7,"<p>2020 has come! But… oops, where did the time go? It’s already March! Belated as it is, it’s time for a refresh of <strong>Community Promotion Ads</strong>!</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>interesting blogs and resources related to data science</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://datascience.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2506"">here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm a data analyst, I studied maths and statistics and I've been working as an analyst for a year and a half. The major tools I use are R language and SQL. At the beginning I though learning Excel would be beneficial to me, so I learnt some basics of data analysis in Excel, but you know what? I find this tool useful only for these ""basics"". Things that are more complicated usually can be done in R more efficiently. So now I treat Excel as a little helper in glancing at the data. Then I took up Python for analysis. What happened? I got to the point where I realised that there's no thing I should do in Python instead of R, because everything doable in Python can be done in R and I can do it much faster in R, because I'm more proficient. People say Python is recommendable for machine learning stuff, but in fact it is all possible in R too.</p>

<p>All in all, tools are just tools. If you know what to do, you should use the tools in which you can accomplish the task in the fastest and the best way. This is a sentence which I find true and it quite discourages me from learning Python and Excel. I hardly can find anything in my job which I can't do in R.</p>

<p>What do I do in my job? The most of times I must answer a question about the business process of my company. I must collect data and then take insight into it - what caused the problem or when the problem existed. Unfortunately, I'm inexperienced and I can't answer these questions on the fly, without any prompt. I must know what to look for.</p>

<p>What I'm interested in the most is this type of task. I would like to get better at it, be more proficient in answering to such questions + convey the data better, create better plots and write more on point conclusions. But how can I do it if not by continuing working and by accomplishing new tasks? I believe it's a thing gained with experience.</p>

<p>What is more, there are tools which I've never seen in action. But even if I learn them, I won't become a proficient user because the only way of becoming really good is spend hours with the tool every day. I know it because I've been using R at the university for 3 years but only after first months of working I've encountered problems which were common, but totally non-existent in a theoretic world of R. What's my second problem with other tools? That in my job I don't feel I need a new tool. It's been quite proven by my Excel and Python experience too.</p>

<p>Of course I work with other data analysts and I could ask them. The thing is that when it comes to analysing data, they use the same tools (sometimes with lower skills in tools themselves) and I see that the only thing that distinguish our abilities is experience and intuition. As I said before, I see no way to become better at it other than just working.</p>

<p>My problem in a nutshell: I want to explain data better, be a better data analyst in general (in order to be paid more) but don't know what I should study. I don't feel that any new programming language will help me do it. On the other hand, if I want to work somewhere else, I should first learn some technologies that I won't use in my current workplace and it means that I won't be able to learn them well.</p>

<p>It sort of does; you get 15 reputation from an accepted answer, which is 1.5 times the 10 reputation you get from an upvote.</p>

<p>The reason that the system works this way is that <em>everyone</em> is able to accept an answer to their question, but <a href=""/help/privileges/vote-up"">upvoting requires 15 reputation</a>. The system could make an exception for this, but exceptions are harder to program and maintain, so it's not done unless there is a real benefit (which is e.g. the case for comments; new users can post comments on their own posts and on answers to their own question, even if they don't have <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment"">50 reputation</a>).</p>

",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>I don't know of such a canonical question/answer, but I will argue in favor of it.</p>
<p>The canonical question/answer gives us a clear place to point users to when we close a question as a duplicate.

With the canonical approach, we can curate a single high-quality question that captures the essence of the common issue, and know that we have one or more high-quality answers to it.</p>
<p>Such resources for beginners may exist on other sites, but we as a community cannot be 100% certain those sites will remain active and the content or links unchanged. With a canonical question/answer on this site, we can be certain that it will survive as long as StackExchange does.</p>

<p>This second question is a chemistry equivalent of a common question novices have. Novices think they are asking what appears to be a simple question, but the true answer amounts to the sum of the knowledge of the field. The overfitting question is similar. The problem is common. Novices may want a quick fix when there are actually a wide range of solutions depending on what you are trying to accomplish.</p>

7,"<p>In general this is one of those very basic questions that I struggle to think a topic more suited for a canonical question in &quot;data science&quot; than this.</p>
<p>However the one problem I see is that any good answer to such questions has two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>One general truth about what overfitting is and what general ways there are to combat it regardless of used language, model, domain, problem, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A more specific operative insight into handling an overfitting problem that won't go away by simply using cross-validation, etc. Since <code>data science SE</code> is an applied topic I would expect good answers and questions here to deal with actual coding problems and therefore solutions would include actual code or library recommendations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously the second part is very hard to put into a canonical question, should we focus on python or R for example, do we recommend a train-test split or cross-validation (depends on the model and problem for me), etc.</p>
<p><strong>In short</strong></p>
<p>I'd argue for general overfitting questions there should be a canonical answer but there will still be a need for more specific overfitting questions and answers.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Any edit (but especially suggested edits) should clean up the post in general. So if I run across a suggested edit in a post that needs much additional editing, I will <kbd>Reject and Edit</kbd> that suggestion.  This has the effect of notifying the original editor that the review was rejected, and can show what the edit could have looked like.</p>

7,"<p>Upvoting, at least for me, is related to the quality of the answer/question and it's general relevance.</p>
<p>If a answer is poorly written or lazy, but solves the problem, accepting it would make sense (since it solves the problem) while upvoting it would not.</p>
<p>Also downvoting an answer you accepted must be really rare. Downvoting an answer is not something taken lightly since you loose reputation for it.</p>
",DataSciencemeta
7,"<p>It seems about right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case 1: would be a common question.</li>
<li>Case 2: would probably be downvoted since it would be a question that doesn't show much effort, if a accepted paper doesn't give that kind of clarification it is probably is from a low quality publisher. Also, SE Academia should be used to ask more general questions about publishing/getting information about academic articles.</li>

7,"<p>The worst of these questions have already been deleted by <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/help/roomba"">an automatic process</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If the question is more than 365 days old, and ...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>has a score of 0 or less, or a score of 1 and a deleted owner</li>
<li>has no answers</li>
<li>is not locked</li>
<li>has view count &lt;= the age of the question in days times 1.5</li>
<li>has 1 or 0 comments</li>
<li>isn't on a meta site</li>
</ul>
<p>... it will be automatically deleted. These are termed &quot;abandoned&quot; questions (<code>RemoveAbandonedQuestions</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there is something that keeps these questions from being deleted: somebody found it useful enough to upvote it, many people end up on the question via a search engine (so it might still be useful to answer it if possible, since many people have a similar problem).</p>
<p>Finally, posts with a negative score will be deleted earlier and with less strict criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If the question is more than 30 days old, and ...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>has −1 or lower score</li>
<li>has no answers</li>
<li>is not locked</li>

<p>...</p>
<p>... it will be automatically deleted. These are termed &quot;dead&quot; questions (<code>RemoveDeadQuestions</code>,</p>

<h3>What are your results so far?</h3>

<li>What models have you training and with what parameters?</li>
<li>Why aren't you satisfied with current results?</li>

<li>Training, Validation and Test curve results</li>
<li>Details about validation procedure (k-fold, leave-of-out, simple split)</li>

<h3>Data Scientists:</h3>
<p>People asking here are suppose to be data scientist, they should at least have the ability to explain their problem and approach to it in order to get help, any question about a particular problem should be long and detailed. Broad questions should de downvoted and closed at first sight.</p>
<h3>Beginners:</h3>
<p>If they are not stuck with a particular concept, they should be directed to basic tutorials. If they seem to simply want to skip the learning process I would just downvote and close the question as too broad or in need of clarity or details.</p>

7,"<p>As Data Science, we base much of our work on intuition and experimentation and this reflects on the kind of questions that end up been asked around DSSE.</p>

7,"<p>For me, an important component is the community and the culture that goes with it. Data Science being quite multidisciplinary brings a few people and fields from different backgrounds. Also, Data Science is in its infancy compared to statistics (Cross Validated) and other domains.</p>
<p>These I think answer the question of why we have this influx of new questions and their answers lagging. Is not consistent. Questions come from every person that wants to do some sort of data analysis and people who can answer those questions may not necessarily be in the Data Science SE (maybe browsing mostly Cross Validated for instance).</p>
<p>I agree with the other answer, in addition, I think it would be a good idea to kind of purge the SE Data Science, maybe even rename it. Purpose it only for some Data Science aspects, like machine learning and its deployment, computer vision, NLP, etc, no questions on how to handle Python or R and how does linear regression work or what kind of regression is best.</p>
<p>I believe in increasing the number of moderators by rewarding them on cleaning questions that do not belong here or are of poor quality. Also, upvote answers which are useful, as it is mentioned in the comments above that another cause of our community not being active is not rewarding valuable answers.</p>
